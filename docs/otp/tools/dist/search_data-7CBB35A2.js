A blank line or a line containing a comment, function head or\npattern in a `case`\\- or `receive` statement is not executable.\n\nCoverage analysis can be used to verify test cases, making sure all relevant\ncode is covered, and may also be helpful when looking for bottlenecks in the\ncode.\n\nBefore any analysis can take place, the involved modules must be _Cover\ncompiled_. This means that some extra information is added to the module before\nit is compiled into a binary which then is loaded. The source file of the module\nis not affected and no `.beam` file is created.\n\nEach time a function in a Cover compiled module is called, information about the\ncall is added to an internal database of Cover. The coverage analysis is\nperformed by examining the contents of the Cover database. The output `Answer`\nis determined by two parameters, `Level` and `Analysis`.\n\n- `Level = module`\n\n  `Answer = {Module,Value}`, where `Module` is the module name.\n\n- `Level = function`\n\n  `Answer = [{Function,Value}]`, one tuple for each function in the module. A\n  function is specified by its module name `M`, function name `F` and arity `A`\n  as a tuple `{M,F,A}`.\n\n- `Level = clause`\n\n  `Answer = [{Clause,Value}]`, one tuple for each clause in the module. A clause\n  is specified by its module name `M`, function name `F`, arity `A` and position\n  in the function definition `C` as a tuple `{M,F,A,C}`.\n\n- `Level = line`\n\n  `Answer = [{Line,Value}]`, one tuple for each executable line in the module. A\n  line is specified by its module name `M` and line number in the source file\n  `N` as a tuple `{M,N}`.\n\n- `Analysis = coverage`\n\n  `Value = {Cov,NotCov}` where `Cov` is the number of executable lines in the\n  module, function, clause or line that have been executed at least once and\n  `NotCov` is the number of executable lines that have not been executed.\n\n- `Analysis = calls`\n\n  `Value = Calls` which is the number of times the module, function, or clause\n  has been called. In the case of line level analysis, `Calls` is the number of\n  times the line has been executed.\n\n_Distribution_\n\nCover can be used in a distributed Erlang system. One of the nodes in the system\nmust then be selected as the _main node_, and all Cover commands must be\nexecuted from this node. The error reason `not_main_node` is returned if an\ninterface function is called on one of the remote nodes.\n\nUse `cover:start/1` and `cover:stop/1` to add or remove nodes. The same Cover\ncompiled code will be loaded on each node, and analysis will collect and sum up\ncoverage data results from all nodes.\n\nTo only collect data from remote nodes without stopping `cover` on those nodes,\nuse `cover:flush/1`\n\nIf the connection to a remote node goes down, the main node will mark it as\nlost. If the node comes back it will be added again. If the remote node was\nalive during the disconnected period, cover data from before and during this\nperiod will be included in the analysis.","ref":"cover.html"},{"type":"module","title":"SEE ALSO - cover","doc":"code(3), compile(3)","ref":"cover.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"function","title":"cover.analyse/0","doc":"","ref":"cover.html#analyse/0"},{"type":"function","title":"cover.analyse/1","doc":"","ref":"cover.html#analyse/1"},{"type":"function","title":"cover.analyse/2","doc":"","ref":"cover.html#analyse/2"},{"type":"function","title":"cover.analyse/3","doc":"Performs analysis of one or more Cover compiled modules, as specified by\n`Analysis` and `Level` (see above), by examining the contents of the internal\ndatabase.\n\n`Analysis` defaults to `coverage` and `Level` defaults to `function`.\n\nIf `Modules` is an atom (one module), the return will be `OneResult`, else the\nreturn will be `{result, Ok, Fail}`.\n\nIf `Modules` is not given, all modules that have data in the cover data table,\nare analysed.

Trace to file is used to minimize runtime performance impact.\n\nThe `fprof` module uses tracing to collect profiling data, hence there is no\nneed for special compilation of any module to be profiled. When it starts\ntracing, `fprof` will erase all previous tracing in the node and set the\nnecessary trace flags on the profiling target processes as well as local call\ntrace on all functions in all loaded modules and all modules to be loaded.\n`fprof` erases all tracing in the node when it stops tracing.\n\n`fprof` presents both _own time_ i.e how much time a function has used for its\nown execution, and _accumulated time_ i.e including called functions. All\npresented times are collected using trace timestamps. `fprof` tries to collect\ncpu time timestamps, if the host machine OS supports it. Therefore the times may\nbe wallclock times and OS scheduling will randomly strike all called functions\nin a presumably fair way.\n\nIf, however, the profiling time is short, and the host machine OS does not\nsupport high resolution cpu time measurements, some few OS schedulings may show\nup as ridiculously long execution times for functions doing practically nothing.\nAn example of a function more or less just composing a tuple in about 100 times\nthe normal execution time has been seen, and when the tracing was repeated, the\nexecution time became normal.\n\nProfiling is essentially done in 3 steps:\n\n- **`1`** - Tracing; to file, as mentioned in the previous paragraph. The trace\n  contains entries for function calls, returns to function, process scheduling,\n  other process related (spawn, etc) events, and garbage collection. All trace\n  entries are timestamped.\n\n- **`2`** - Profiling; the trace file is read, the execution call stack is\n  simulated, and raw profile data is calculated from the simulated call stack\n  and the trace timestamps. The profile data is stored in the `fprof` server\n  state. During this step the trace data may be dumped in text format to file or\n  console.\n\n- **`3`** - Analysing; the raw profile data is sorted, filtered and dumped in\n  text format either to file or console. The text format intended to be both\n  readable for a human reader, as well as parsable with the standard erlang\n  parsing tools.\n\nSince `fprof` uses trace to file, the runtime performance degradation is\nminimized, but still far from negligible, especially for programs that use the\nfilesystem heavily by themselves. Where you place the trace file is also\nimportant, e.g on Solaris `/tmp` is usually a good choice since it is\nessentially a RAM disk, while any NFS (network) mounted disk is a bad idea.\n\n`fprof` can also skip the file step and trace to a tracer process that does the\nprofiling in runtime.\n\n[](){: id=analysis }","ref":"fprof.html"},{"type":"module","title":"Analysis format - fprof","doc":"This section describes the output format of the analyse command. See\n`analyse/0`.\n\nThe format is parsable with the standard Erlang parsing tools `erl_scan` and\n`erl_parse`, `file:consult/1` or `io:read/2`. The parse format is not explained\nhere - it should be easy for the interested to try it out. Note that some flags\nto `analyse/1` will affect the format.\n\nThe following example was run on OTP/R8 on Solaris 8, all OTP internals in this\nexample are very version dependent.\n\nAs an example, we will use the following function, that you may recognise as a\nslightly modified benchmark function from the manpage file(3):\n\n```text\n-module(foo).\n-export([create_file_slow/2]).\n\ncreate_file_slow(Name, N) when is_integer(N), N >= 0 ->\n    {ok, FD} =\n        file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),\n    if N > 256 ->\n            ok = file:write(FD,\n                            lists:map(fun (X) -> < > end,\n                            lists:seq(0, 255))),\n            ok = create_file_slow(FD, 256, N);\n       true ->\n            ok = create_file_slow(FD, 0, N)\n    end,\n    ok = file:close(FD).\n\ncreate_file_slow(FD, M, M) ->\n    ok;\ncreate_file_slow(FD, M, N) ->\n    ok = file:write(FD, < >),\n    create_file_slow(FD, M+1, N).\n```\n\nLet us have a look at the printout after running:\n\n```text\n1> fprof:apply(foo, create_file_slow, [junk, 1024]).\n2> fprof:profile().\n3> fprof:analyse().\n```\n\nThe printout starts with:\n\n```text\n%% Analysis results:\n{  analysis_options,\n [{callers, true},\n  {sort, acc},\n  {totals, false},\n  {details, true}]}.\n\n%                                       CNT       ACC       OWN\n[{ totals,                             9627, 1691.119, 1659.074}].  %%%\n```\n\nThe CNT column shows the total number of function calls that was found in the\ntrace. In the ACC column is the total time of the trace from first timestamp to\nlast. And in the OWN column is the sum of the execution time in functions found\nin the trace, not including called functions. In this case it is very close to\nthe ACC time since the emulator had practically nothing else to do than to\nexecute our test program.\n\nAll time values in the printout are in milliseconds.\n\nThe printout continues:\n\n```text\n%                                       CNT       ACC       OWN\n[{ \"<0.28.0>\",                         9627,undefined, 1659.074}].   %%\n```\n\nThis is the printout header of one process. The printout contains only this one\nprocess since we did `fprof:apply/3` which traces only the current process.\nTherefore the CNT and OWN columns perfectly matches the totals above. The ACC\ncolumn is undefined since summing the ACC times of all calls in the process\nmakes no sense - you would get something like the ACC value from totals above\nmultiplied by the average depth of the call stack, or something.\n\nAll paragraphs up to the next process header only concerns function calls within\nthis process.\n\nNow we come to something more interesting:\n\n```text\n{[{undefined,                             0, 1691.076,    0.030}],\n { {fprof,apply_start_stop,4},            0, 1691.076,    0.030},     %\n [{{foo,create_file_slow,2},              1, 1691.046,    0.103},\n  {suspend,                               1,    0.000,    0.000}]}.\n\n{[{{fprof,apply_start_stop,4},            1, 1691.046,    0.103}],\n { {foo,create_file_slow,2},              1, 1691.046,    0.103},     %\n [{{file,close,1},                        1, 1398.873,    0.019},\n  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},              1,  249.678,    0.029},\n  {{file,open,2},                         1,   20.778,    0.055},\n  {{lists,map,2},                         1,   16.590,    0.043},\n  {{lists,seq,2},                         1,    4.708,    0.017},\n  {{file,write,2},                        1,    0.316,    0.021}]}.\n```\n\nThe printout consists of one paragraph per called function. The function\n_marked_ with '%' is the one the paragraph concerns - `foo:create_file_slow/2`.\nAbove the marked function are the _calling_ functions - those that has called\nthe marked, and below are those _called_ by the marked function.\n\nThe paragraphs are per default sorted in decreasing order of the ACC column for\nthe marked function. The calling list and called list within one paragraph are\nalso per default sorted in decreasing order of their ACC column.\n\nThe columns are: CNT - the number of times the function has been called, ACC -\nthe time spent in the function including called functions, and OWN - the time\nspent in the function not including called functions.\n\nThe rows for the _calling_ functions contain statistics for the _marked_\nfunction with the constraint that only the occasions when a call was made from\nthe _row's_ function to the _marked_ function are accounted for.\n\nThe row for the _marked_ function simply contains the sum of all _calling_ rows.\n\nThe rows for the _called_ functions contains statistics for the _row's_ function\nwith the constraint that only the occasions when a call was made from the\n_marked_ to the _row's_ function are accounted for.\n\nSo, we see that `foo:create_file_slow/2` used very little time for its own\nexecution. It spent most of its time in `file:close/1`. The function\n`foo:create_file_slow/3` that writes 3/4 of the file contents is the second\nbiggest time thief.\n\nWe also see that the call to `file:write/2` that writes 1/4 of the file contents\ntakes very little time in itself. What takes time is to build the data\n(`lists:seq/2` and `lists:map/2`).\n\nThe function 'undefined' that has called `fprof:apply_start_stop/4` is an\nunknown function because that call was not recorded in the trace. It was only\nrecorded that the execution returned from `fprof:apply_start_stop/4` to some\nother function above in the call stack, or that the process exited from there.\n\nLet us continue down the printout to find:\n\n```text\n{[{{foo,create_file_slow,2},              1,  249.678,    0.029},\n  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},            768,    0.000,   23.294}],\n { {foo,create_file_slow,3},            769,  249.678,   23.323},     %\n [{{file,write,2},                      768,  220.314,   14.539},\n  {suspend,                              57,    6.041,    0.000},\n  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},            768,    0.000,   23.294}]}.\n```\n\nIf you compare with the code you will see there also that\n`foo:create_file_slow/3` was called only from `foo:create_file_slow/2` and\nitself, and called only `file:write/2`, note the number of calls to\n`file:write/2`. But here we see that `suspend` was called a few times. This is a\npseudo function that indicates that the process was suspended while executing in\n`foo:create_file_slow/3`, and since there is no `receive` or `erlang:yield/0` in\nthe code, it must be Erlang scheduling suspensions, or the trace file driver\ncompensating for large file write operations (these are regarded as a schedule\nout followed by a schedule in to the same process).\n\nLet us find the `suspend` entry:\n\n```text\n{[{{file,write,2},                       53,    6.281,    0.000},\n  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},             57,    6.041,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,drv_command,4},            50,    4.582,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,drv_get_response,1},       34,    2.986,    0.000},\n  {{lists,map,2},                        10,    2.104,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,write,2},                  17,    1.852,    0.000},\n  {{erlang,port_command,2},              15,    1.713,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,drv_command,2},            22,    1.482,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,translate_response,2},     11,    1.441,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,'-drv_command/2-fun-0-',1},  15,    1.340,    0.000},\n  {{lists,seq,4},                         3,    0.880,    0.000},\n  {{foo,'-create_file_slow/2-fun-0-',1},   5,    0.523,    0.000},\n  {{erlang,bump_reductions,1},            4,    0.503,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        1,    0.165,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,i32,4},                     1,    0.109,    0.000},\n  {{fprof,apply_start_stop,4},            1,    0.000,    0.000}],\n { suspend,                             299,   32.002,    0.000},     %\n [ ]}.\n```\n\nWe find no particularly long suspend times, so no function seems to have waited\nin a receive statement. Actually, `prim_file:drv_command/4` contains a receive\nstatement, but in this test program, the message lies in the process receive\nbuffer when the receive statement is entered. We also see that the total suspend\ntime for the test run is small.\n\nThe `suspend` pseudo function has got an OWN time of zero. This is to prevent\nthe process total OWN time from including time in suspension. Whether suspend\ntime is really ACC or OWN time is more of a philosophical question.\n\nNow we look at another interesting pseudo function, `garbage_collect`:\n\n```text\n{[{{prim_file,drv_command,4},            25,    0.873,    0.873},\n  {{prim_file,write,2},                  16,    0.692,    0.692},\n  {{lists,map,2},                         2,    0.195,    0.195}],\n { garbage_collect,                      43,    1.760,    1.760},     %\n [ ]}.\n```\n\nHere we see that no function distinguishes itself considerably, which is very\nnormal.\n\nThe `garbage_collect` pseudo function has not got an OWN time of zero like\n`suspend`, instead it is equal to the ACC time.\n\nGarbage collect often occurs while a process is suspended, but `fprof` hides\nthis fact by pretending that the suspended function was first unsuspended and\nthen garbage collected. Otherwise the printout would show `garbage_collect`\nbeing called from `suspend` but not which function that might have caused the\ngarbage collection.\n\nLet us now get back to the test code:\n\n```text\n{[{{foo,create_file_slow,3},            768,  220.314,   14.539},\n  {{foo,create_file_slow,2},              1,    0.316,    0.021}],\n { {file,write,2},                      769,  220.630,   14.560},     %\n [{{prim_file,write,2},                 769,  199.789,   22.573},\n  {suspend,                              53,    6.281,    0.000}]}.\n```\n\nNot unexpectedly, we see that `file:write/2` was called from\n`foo:create_file_slow/3` and `foo:create_file_slow/2`. The number of calls in\neach case as well as the used time are also just confirms the previous results.\n\nWe see that `file:write/2` only calls `prim_file:write/2`, but let us refrain\nfrom digging into the internals of the kernel application.\n\nBut, if we nevertheless _do_ dig down we find the call to the linked in driver\nthat does the file operations towards the host operating system:\n\n```text\n{[{{prim_file,drv_command,4},           772, 1458.356, 1456.643}],\n { {erlang,port_command,2},             772, 1458.356, 1456.643},     %\n [{suspend,                              15,    1.713,    0.000}]}.\n```\n\nThis is 86 % of the total run time, and as we saw before it is the close\noperation the absolutely biggest contributor. We find a comparison ratio a\nlittle bit up in the call stack:\n\n```text\n{[{{prim_file,close,1},                   1, 1398.748,    0.024},\n  {{prim_file,write,2},                 769,  174.672,   12.810},\n  {{prim_file,open_int,4},                1,   19.755,    0.017},\n  {{prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        1,    0.147,    0.016}],\n { {prim_file,drv_command,2},           772, 1593.322,   12.867},     %\n [{{prim_file,drv_command,4},           772, 1578.973,   27.265},\n  {suspend,                              22,    1.482,    0.000}]}.\n```\n\nThe time for file operations in the linked in driver distributes itself as 1 %\nfor open, 11 % for write and 87 % for close. All data is probably buffered in\nthe operating system until the close.\n\nThe unsleeping reader may notice that the ACC times for\n`prim_file:drv_command/2` and `prim_file:drv_command/4` is not equal between the\nparagraphs above, even though it is easy to believe that\n`prim_file:drv_command/2` is just a passthrough function.\n\nThe missing time can be found in the paragraph for `prim_file:drv_command/4`\nwhere it is evident that not only `prim_file:drv_command/2` is called but also a\nfun:\n\n```text\n{[{{prim_file,drv_command,2},           772, 1578.973,   27.265}],\n { {prim_file,drv_command,4},           772, 1578.973,   27.265},     %\n [{{erlang,port_command,2},             772, 1458.356, 1456.643},\n  {{prim_file,'-drv_command/2-fun-0-',1}, 772,   87.897,   12.736},\n  {suspend,                              50,    4.582,    0.000},\n  {garbage_collect,                      25,    0.873,    0.873}]}.\n```\n\nAnd some more missing time can be explained by the fact that\n`prim_file:open_int/4` both calls `prim_file:drv_command/2` directly as well as\nthrough `prim_file:open_int_setopts/3`, which complicates the picture.\n\n```text\n{[{{prim_file,open,2},                    1,   20.309,    0.029},\n  {{prim_file,open_int,4},                1,    0.000,    0.057}],\n { {prim_file,open_int,4},                2,   20.309,    0.086},     %\n [{{prim_file,drv_command,2},             1,   19.755,    0.017},\n  {{prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        1,    0.360,    0.032},\n  {{prim_file,drv_open,2},                1,    0.071,    0.030},\n  {{erlang,list_to_binary,1},             1,    0.020,    0.020},\n  {{prim_file,i32,1},                     1,    0.017,    0.017},\n  {{prim_file,open_int,4},                1,    0.000,    0.057}]}.\n.\n.\n.\n{[{{prim_file,open_int,4},                1,    0.360,    0.032},\n  {{prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        1,    0.000,    0.016}],\n { {prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        2,    0.360,    0.048},     %\n [{suspend,                               1,    0.165,    0.000},\n  {{prim_file,drv_command,2},             1,    0.147,    0.016},\n  {{prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        1,    0.000,    0.016}]}.\n```","ref":"fprof.html#module-analysis-format"},{"type":"module","title":"Notes - fprof","doc":"The actual supervision of execution times is in itself a CPU intensive activity.\nA message is written on the trace file for every function call that is made by\nthe profiled code.\n\nThe ACC time calculation is sometimes difficult to make correct, since it is\ndifficult to define.

With `lcnt` enabled, internal counters in the runtime system are\nupdated each time a lock is taken. The counters stores information about the\nnumber of acquisition tries and the number of collisions that has occurred\nduring the acquisition tries. The counters also record the waiting time a lock\nhas caused for a blocked thread when a collision has occurred.\n\nThe data produced by the lock counters will give an estimate on how well the\nruntime system will behave from a parallelizable view point for the scenarios\ntested. This tool was mainly developed to help Erlang runtime developers iron\nout potential and generic bottlenecks.\n\nLocks in the emulator are named after what type of resource they protect and\nwhere in the emulator they are initialized, those are lock 'classes'. Most of\nthose locks are also instantiated several times, and given unique identifiers,\nto increase locking granularity. Typically an instantiated lock protects a\ndisjunct set of the resource, for example ets tables, processes or ports. In\nother cases it protects a specific range of a resource, for example `pix_lock`\nwhich protects index to process mappings, and is given a unique number within\nthe class. A unique lock in `lcnt` is referenced by a name (class) and an\nidentifier: `{Name, Id}`.\n\nSome locks in the system are static and protects global resources, for example\n`bif_timers` and the `run_queue` locks. Other locks are dynamic and not\nnecessarily long lived, for example process locks and ets-table locks. The\nstatistics data from short lived locks can be stored separately when the locks\nare deleted. This behavior is by default turned off to save memory but can be\nturned on via `lcnt:rt_opt({copy_save, true})`.

There is more to read about applications and releases in\nthe Design Principles book.\n\n_Xref servers_{: id=xref_server } are identified by names, supplied when\ncreating new servers. Each Xref server holds a set of releases, a set of\napplications, and a set of modules with module data. Xref servers are\nindependent of each other, and all analyses are evaluated in the context of one\nsingle Xref server (exceptions are the functions `m/1` and `d/1` which do not\nuse servers at all). The _mode_{: id=mode } of an Xref server determines what\nmodule data are extracted from BEAM files as modules are added to the server.\nStarting with R7, BEAM files compiled with the option `debug_info` contain so\ncalled [](){: id=debug_info } debug information, which is an abstract\nrepresentation of the code. In `functions` mode, which is the default mode,\nfunction calls and line numbers are extracted from debug information. In\n`modules` mode, debug information is ignored if present, but dependencies\nbetween modules are extracted from other parts of the BEAM files.

A library module is said to be used if some\nof its exported functions are used by some analyzed module. An _unknown\nmodule_{: id=unknown_module } is a module that is neither an analyzed module nor\na library module, but whose exported functions are used by some analyzed module.\nAn _unknown function_{: id=unknown_function } is a used function that is neither\nlocal or exported by any analyzed module nor exported by any library module. An\n_undefined function_{: id=undefined_function } is an externally used function\nthat is not exported by any analyzed module or library module. With this notion,\na local function can be an undefined function, namely if it is externally used\nfrom some module. All unknown functions are also undefined functions; there is a\n[figure](xref_chapter.md#venn2) in the User's Guide that illustrates this\nrelationship.\n\nStarting with R9C, the module attribute tag `deprecated` can be used to inform\nXref about _deprecated functions_{: id=deprecated_function } and optionally when\nfunctions are planned to be removed. A few examples show the idea:\n\n- **\\-deprecated(\\{f,1\\}).** - The exported function `f/1` is deprecated.\n  Nothing is said whether `f/1` will be removed or not.\n\n- **\\-deprecated(\\{f,1,\"Use g/1 instead\"\\}).** - As above but with a descriptive\n  string.

For instance,\nthe cross reference and the unknown functions are computed when all module data\nare known. The functions that need complete data (`analyze`, `q`, `variables`)\ntake care of setting up data automatically. Module data need to be set up\n(again) after calls to any of the `add`, `replace`, `remove`, `set_library_path`\nor `update` functions.\n\nThe result of setting up module data is the _Call Graph_{: id=call_graph }. A\n(directed) graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of (directed) edges.\nThe edges represent _calls_{: id=call } (From, To) between functions, modules,\napplications or releases. From is said to call To, and To is said to be used by\nFrom. The vertices of the Call Graph are the functions of all module data: local\nand exported functions of analyzed modules; used BIFs; used exported functions\nof library modules; and unknown functions. The functions `module_info/0,1` added\nby the compiler are included among the exported functions, but only when called\nfrom some module. The edges are the function calls of all module data. A\nconsequence of the edges being a set is that there is only one edge if a\nfunction is locally or externally used several times on one and the same line of\ncode.\n\nThe Call Graph is [](){: id=representation } represented by Erlang terms (the\nsets are lists), which is suitable for many analyses. But for analyses that look\nat chains of calls, a list representation is much too slow. Instead the\nrepresentation offered by the `digraph` module is used. The translation of the\nlist representation of the Call Graph - or a subgraph thereof - to the `digraph`\nrepresentation does not come for free, so the language used for expressing\nqueries to be described below has a special operator for this task and a\npossibility to save the `digraph` representation for subsequent analyses.\n\nIn addition to the Call Graph there is a graph called the _Inter Call Graph_{:\nid=inter_call_graph }. This is a graph of calls (From, To) such that there is a\nchain of calls from From to To in the Call Graph, and every From and To is an\nexported function or an unused local function. The vertices are the same as for\nthe Call Graph.\n\nCalls between modules, applications and releases are also directed graphs. The\n_types_{: id=type } of the vertices and edges of these graphs are (ranging from\nthe most special to the most general): `Fun` for functions; `Mod` for modules;\n`App` for applications; and `Rel` for releases. The following paragraphs will\ndescribe the different constructs of the language used for selecting and\nanalyzing parts of the graphs, beginning with the _constants_{: id=constants }:\n\n- Expression ::= Constants\n- Constants ::= Consts | Consts `:` Type | RegExpr\n- Consts ::= Constant | `[`Constant`,` ...`]` | `{`Constant`,` ...`}`\n- Constant ::= Call | Const\n- Call ::= FunSpec `->` FunSpec | `{`MFA`,` MFA`}` | AtomConst `->` AtomConst |\n  `{`AtomConst`,` AtomConst`}`\n- Const ::= AtomConst | FunSpec | MFA\n- AtomConst ::= Application | Module | Release\n- FunSpec ::= Module `:` Function `/` Arity\n- MFA ::= `{`Module`,` Function`,` Arity`}`\n- RegExpr ::= RegString `:` Type | RegFunc | RegFunc `:` Type\n- RegFunc ::= RegModule `:` RegFunction `/` RegArity\n- RegModule ::= RegAtom\n- RegFunction ::= RegAtom\n- RegArity ::= RegString | Number | `_` | `-1`\n- RegAtom ::= RegString | Atom | `_`\n- RegString ::= - a regular expression, as described in the `re` module,\n  enclosed in double quotes -\n- Type ::= `Fun` | `Mod` | `App` | `Rel`\n- Function ::= Atom\n- Application ::= Atom\n- Module ::= Atom\n- Release ::= Atom\n- Arity ::= Number | `-1`\n- Atom ::= - same as Erlang atoms -\n- Number ::= - same as non-negative Erlang integers -\n\nExamples of constants are: `kernel`, `kernel->stdlib`, `[kernel, sasl]`,\n`[pg -> mnesia, {tv, mnesia}] : Mod`. It is an error if an instance of `Const`\ndoes not match any vertex of any graph. If there are more than one vertex\nmatching an untyped instance of `AtomConst`, then the one of the most general\ntype is chosen. A list of constants is interpreted as a set of constants, all of\nthe same type. A tuple of constants constitute a chain of calls (which may, but\ndoes not have to, correspond to an actual chain of calls of some graph).\nAssigning a type to a list or tuple of `Constant` is equivalent to assigning the\ntype to each `Constant`.\n\n_Regular expressions_{: id=regexp } are used as a means to select some of the\nvertices of a graph. A `RegExpr` consisting of a `RegString` and a type - an\nexample is `\"xref_.*\" : Mod` \\- is interpreted as those modules (or applications\nor releases, depending on the type) that match the expression. Similarly, a\n`RegFunc` is interpreted as those vertices of the Call Graph that match the\nexpression. An example is `\"xref_.*\":\"add_.*\"/\"(2|3)\"`, which matches all `add`\nfunctions of arity two or three of any of the xref modules. Another example, one\nthat matches all functions of arity 10 or more: `_:_/\"[1-9].+\"`. Here `_` is an\nabbreviation for `\".*\"`, that is, the regular expression that matches anything.\n\nThe syntax of _variables_{: id=variable } is simple:\n\n- Expression ::= Variable\n- Variable ::= - same as Erlang variables -\n\nThere are two kinds of variables: predefined variables and user variables.\n_Predefined variables_{: id=predefined_variable } hold set up module data, and\ncannot be assigned to but only used in queries. _User variables_{:\nid=user_variable } on the other hand can be assigned to, and are typically used\nfor temporary results while evaluating a query, and for keeping results of\nqueries for use in subsequent queries. The predefined variables are (variables\nmarked with (\\*) are available in `functions` mode only):\n\n- **`E`** - Call Graph Edges (\\*).\n\n- **`V`** - Call Graph Vertices (\\*).\n\n- **`M`** - Modules. All modules: analyzed modules, used library modules, and\n  unknown modules.\n\n- **`A`** - Applications.\n\n- **`R`** - Releases.\n\n- **`ME`** - Module Edges. All module calls.\n\n- **`AE`** - Application Edges. All application calls.\n\n- **`RE`** - Release Edges. All release calls.\n\n- **`L`** - Local Functions (\\*). All local functions of analyzed modules.\n\n- **`X`** - Exported Functions. All exported functions of analyzed modules and\n  all used exported functions of library modules.\n\n- **`F`** - Functions (\\*).\n\n- **`B`** - Used BIFs. `B` is empty if `builtins` is `false` for all analyzed\n  modules.\n\n- **`U`** - Unknown Functions.\n\n- **`UU`** - Unused Functions (\\*). All local and exported functions of analyzed\n  modules that have not been used.\n\n- **`XU`** - Externally Used Functions. Functions of all modules - including\n  local functions - that have been used in some external call.\n\n- **`LU`** - Locally Used Functions (\\*). Functions of all modules that have\n  been used in some local call.\n\n- **`OL`** - Functions with an attribute tag `on_load` (\\*).\n\n- **`LC`** - Local Calls (\\*).\n\n- **`XC`** - External Calls (\\*).\n\n- **`AM`** - Analyzed Modules.\n\n- **`UM`** - Unknown Modules.\n\n- **`LM`** - Used Library Modules.\n\n- **`UC`** - Unresolved Calls. Empty in `modules` mode.\n\n- **`EE`** - Inter Call Graph Edges (\\*).\n\n- **`DF`** - Deprecated Functions. All deprecated exported functions and all\n  used deprecated BIFs.\n\n- **`DF_1`** - Deprecated Functions. All deprecated functions to be removed in\n  next version.\n\n- **`DF_2`** - Deprecated Functions. All deprecated functions to be removed in\n  next version or next major release.\n\n- **`DF_3`** - Deprecated Functions. All deprecated functions to be removed in\n  next version, next major release, or later.\n\nThese are a few [](){: id=simple_facts } facts about the predefined variables\n(the set operators `+` (union) and `-` (difference) as well as the cast operator\n`(`Type`)` are described below):\n\n- `F` is equal to `L + X`.\n- `V` is equal to `X + L + B + U`, where `X`, `L`, `B` and `U` are pairwise\n  disjoint (that is, have no elements in common).\n- `UU` is equal to `V - (XU + LU)`, where `LU` and `XU` may have elements in\n  common. Put in another way:\n- `V` is equal to `UU + XU + LU`.\n- `OL` is a subset of `F`.\n- `E` is equal to `LC + XC`. Note that `LC` and `XC` may have elements in\n  common, namely if some function is locally and externally used from one and\n  the same function.\n- `U` is a subset of `XU`.\n- `B` is a subset of `XU`.\n- `LU` is equal to `range LC`.\n- `XU` is equal to `range XC`.\n- `LU` is a subset of `F`.\n- `UU` is a subset of `F`.\n- `range UC` is a subset of `U`.\n- `M` is equal to `AM + LM + UM`, where `AM`, `LM` and `UM` are pairwise\n  disjoint.\n- `ME` is equal to `(Mod) E`.\n- `AE` is equal to `(App) E`.\n- `RE` is equal to `(Rel) E`.\n- `(Mod) V` is a subset of `M`. Equality holds if all analyzed modules have some\n  local, exported, or unknown function.\n- `(App) M` is a subset of `A`. Equality holds if all applications have some\n  module.\n- `(Rel) A` is a subset of `R`. Equality holds if all releases have some\n  application.\n- `DF_1` is a subset of `DF_2`.\n- `DF_2` is a subset of `DF_3`.\n- `DF_3` is a subset of `DF`.\n- `DF` is a subset of `X + B`.\n\nAn important notion is that of _conversion_{: id=conversion } of expressions.\nThe syntax of a cast expression is:\n\n- Expression ::= `(` Type `)` Expression\n\nThe interpretation of the cast operator depends on the named type `Type`, the\ntype of `Expression`, and the structure of the elements of the interpretation of\n`Expression`. If the named type is equal to the expression type, no conversion\nis done. Otherwise, the conversion is done one step at a time; `(Fun) (App) RE`,\nfor instance, is equivalent to `(Fun) (Mod) (App) RE`. Now assume that the\ninterpretation of `Expression` is a set of constants (functions, modules,\napplications or releases). If the named type is more general than the expression\ntype, say `Mod` and `Fun` respectively, then the interpretation of the cast\nexpression is the set of modules that have at least one of their functions\nmentioned in the interpretation of the expression. If the named type is more\nspecial than the expression type, say `Fun` and `Mod`, then the interpretation\nis the set of all the functions of the modules (in `modules` mode, the\nconversion is partial since the local functions are not known). The conversions\nto and from applications and releases work analogously. For instance,\n`(App) \"xref_.*\" : Mod` returns all applications containing at least one module\nsuch that `xref_` is a prefix of the module name.\n\nNow assume that the interpretation of `Expression` is a set of calls. If the\nnamed type is more general than the expression type, say `Mod` and `Fun`\nrespectively, then the interpretation of the cast expression is the set of calls\n(M1, M2) such that the interpretation of the expression contains a call from\nsome function of M1 to some function of M2. If the named type is more special\nthan the expression type, say `Fun` and `Mod`, then the interpretation is the\nset of all function calls (F1, F2) such that the interpretation of the\nexpression contains a call (M1, M2) and F1 is a function of M1 and F2 is a\nfunction of M2 (in `modules` mode, there are no functions calls, so a cast to\n`Fun` always yields an empty set). Again, the conversions to and from\napplications and releases work analogously.\n\nThe interpretation of constants and variables are sets, and those sets can be\nused as the basis for forming new sets by the application of _set operators_{:\nid=set_operator }. The syntax:\n\n- Expression ::= Expression BinarySetOp Expression\n- BinarySetOp ::= `+` | `*` | `-`\n\n`+`, `*` and `-` are interpreted as union, intersection and difference\nrespectively: the union of two sets contains the elements of both sets; the\nintersection of two sets contains the elements common to both sets; and the\ndifference of two sets contains the elements of the first set that are not\nmembers of the second set. The elements of the two sets must be of the same\nstructure; for instance, a function call cannot be combined with a function. But\nif a cast operator can make the elements compatible, then the more general\nelements are converted to the less general element type. For instance, `M + F`\nis equivalent to `(Fun) M + F`, and `E - AE` is equivalent to `E - (Fun) AE`.\nOne more example: `X * xref : Mod` is interpreted as the set of functions\nexported by the module `xref`; `xref : Mod` is converted to the more special\ntype of `X` (`Fun`, that is) yielding all functions of `xref`, and the\nintersection with `X` (all functions exported by analyzed modules and library\nmodules) is interpreted as those functions that are exported by some module\n_and_ functions of `xref`.\n\nThere are also unary set operators:\n\n- Expression ::= UnarySetOp Expression\n- UnarySetOp ::= `domain` | `range` | `strict`\n\nRecall that a call is a pair (From, To). `domain` applied to a set of calls is\ninterpreted as the set of all vertices From, and `range` as the set of all\nvertices To. The interpretation of the `strict` operator is the operand with all\ncalls on the form (A, A) removed.\n\nThe interpretation of the _restriction operators_{: id=restriction } is a subset\nof the first operand, a set of calls. The second operand, a set of vertices, is\nconverted to the type of the first operand. The syntax of the restriction\noperators:\n\n- Expression ::= Expression RestrOp Expression\n- RestrOp ::= `|`\n- RestrOp ::= `||`\n- RestrOp ::= `|||`\n\nThe interpretation in some detail for the three operators:\n\n- **`|`** - The subset of calls from any of the vertices.\n\n- **`||`** - The subset of calls to any of the vertices.\n\n- **`|||`** - The subset of calls to and from any of the vertices. For all sets\n  of calls `CS` and all sets of vertices `VS`, `CS ||| VS ` is equivalent to\n  `CS | VS * CS || VS`.\n\n[](){: id=graph_analyses } Two functions (modules, applications, releases)\nbelong to the same strongly connected component if they call each other\n(in)directly. The interpretation of the `components` operator is the set of\nstrongly connected components of a set of calls. The `condensation` of a set of\ncalls is a new set of calls between the strongly connected components such that\nthere is an edge between two components if there is some constant of the first\ncomponent that calls some constant of the second component.\n\nThe interpretation of the `of` operator is a chain of calls of the second\noperand (a set of calls) that passes throw all of the vertices of the first\noperand (a tuple of constants), in the given order. The second operand is\nconverted to the type of the first operand. For instance, the `of` operator can\nbe used for finding out whether a function calls another function indirectly,\nand the chain of calls demonstrates how. The syntax of the graph analyzing\noperators:\n\n- Expression ::= Expression BinaryGraphOp Expression\n- Expression ::= UnaryGraphOp Expression\n- UnaryGraphOp ::= `components` | `condensation`\n- BinaryGraphOp ::= `of`\n\nAs was mentioned before, the graph analyses operate on the `digraph`\nrepresentation of graphs. By default, the `digraph` representation is created\nwhen needed (and deleted when no longer used), but it can also be created\nexplicitly by use of the `closure` operator:\n\n- Expression ::= ClosureOp Expression\n- ClosureOp ::= `closure`\n\nThe interpretation of the `closure` operator is the transitive closure of the\noperand.\n\nThe restriction operators are defined for closures as well;\n`closure E | xref : Mod` is interpreted as the direct or indirect function calls\nfrom the `xref` module, while the interpretation of `E | xref : Mod` is the set\nof direct calls from `xref`. If some graph is to be used in several graph\nanalyses, it saves time to assign the `digraph` representation of the graph to a\nuser variable, and then make sure that every graph analysis operates on that\nvariable instead of the list representation of the graph.\n\nThe lines where functions are defined (more precisely: where the first clause\nbegins) and the lines where functions are used are available in `functions`\nmode. The line numbers refer to the files where the functions are defined. This\nholds also for files included with the `-include` and `-include_lib` directives,\nwhich may result in functions defined apparently in the same line. The _line\noperators_ are used for assigning line numbers to functions and for assigning\nsets of line numbers to function calls. The syntax is similar to the one of the\ncast operator:\n\n- Expression ::= `(` LineOp`)` Expression\n- Expression ::= `(` XLineOp`)` Expression\n- LineOp ::= `Lin` | `ELin` | `LLin` | `XLin`\n- XLineOp ::= `XXL`\n\nThe interpretation of the `Lin` operator applied to a set of functions assigns\nto each function the line number where the function is defined. Unknown\nfunctions and functions of library modules are assigned the number 0.\n\nThe interpretation of some LineOp operator applied to a set of function calls\nassigns to each call the set of line numbers where the first function calls the\nsecond function. Not all calls are assigned line numbers by all operators:\n\n- the `Lin` operator is defined for Call Graph Edges;\n- the `LLin` operator is defined for Local Calls.\n- the `XLin` operator is defined for External Calls.\n- the `ELin` operator is defined for Inter Call Graph Edges.\n\nThe `Lin` (`LLin`, `XLin`) operator assigns the lines where calls (local calls,\nexternal calls) are made. The `ELin` operator assigns to each call (From, To),\nfor which it is defined, every line L such that there is a chain of calls from\nFrom to To beginning with a call on line L.\n\nThe `XXL` operator is defined for the interpretation of any of the LineOp\noperators applied to a set of function calls. The result is that of replacing\nthe function call with a line numbered function call, that is, each of the two\nfunctions of the call is replaced by a pair of the function and the line where\nthe function is defined. The effect of the `XXL` operator can be undone by the\nLineOp operators. For instance, `(Lin) (XXL) (Lin) E` is equivalent to\n`(Lin) E`.\n\nThe `+`, `-`, `*` and `#` operators are defined for line number expressions,\nprovided the operands are compatible. The LineOp operators are also defined for\nmodules, applications, and releases; the operand is implicitly converted to\nfunctions. Similarly, the cast operator is defined for the interpretation of the\nLineOp operators.\n\nThe interpretation of the _counting operator_{: id=count } is the number of\nelements of a set. The operator is undefined for closures. The `+`, `-` and `*`\noperators are interpreted as the obvious arithmetical operators when applied to\nnumbers. The syntax of the counting operator:\n\n- Expression ::= CountOp Expression\n- CountOp ::= `#`\n\nAll binary operators are left associative; for instance, `A | B  || C` is\nequivalent to `(A | B) || C`. The following is a list of all operators, in\nincreasing order of _precedence_{: id=precedence }:\n\n- `+`, `-`\n- `*`\n- `#`\n- `|`, `||`, `|||`\n- `of`\n- `(`Type`)`\n- `closure`, `components`, `condensation`, `domain`, `range`, `strict`\n\nParentheses are used for grouping, either to make an expression more readable or\nto override the default precedence of operators:\n\n- Expression ::= `(` Expression `)`\n\nA _query_{: id=query } is a non-empty sequence of statements. A statement is\neither an assignment of a user variable or an expression. The value of an\nassignment is the value of the right hand side expression. It makes no sense to\nput a plain expression anywhere else but last in queries. The syntax of queries\nis summarized by these productions:\n\n- Query ::= Statement`,` ...\n- Statement ::= Assignment | Expression\n- Assignment ::= Variable `:=` Expression | Variable `=` Expression\n\nA variable cannot be assigned a new value unless first removed. Variables\nassigned to by the `=` operator are removed at the end of the query, while\nvariables assigned to by the `:=` operator can only be removed by calls to\n`forget`. There are no user variables when module data need to be set up again;\nif any of the functions that make it necessary to set up module data again is\ncalled, all user variables are forgotten.","ref":"xref.html#module-warning-class-warning"},{"type":"module","title":"See Also - xref","doc":"`m:beam_lib`, `m:digraph`, `m:digraph_utils`, `m:re`,\n[TOOLS User's Guide](xref_chapter.md)","ref":"xref.html#module-see-also"},{"type":"function","title":"xref.add_application/2","doc":"","ref":"xref.html#add_application/2"},{"type":"function","title":"xref.add_application/3","doc":"Adds an application, the modules of the application and\n[module data](`m:xref#module_data`) of the modules to an\n[Xref server](`m:xref#xref_server`).

Therefore there is no need for special compilation of\nany module to be profiled.\n\n`cprof` presents all profiled modules in decreasing total call count order, and\nfor each module presents all profiled functions also in decreasing call count\norder. A call count limit can be specified to filter out all functions below the\nlimit.\n\nProfiling is done in the following steps:\n\n- **`cprof:start/0..3`** - Starts profiling with zeroed call counters for\n  specified functions by setting call count breakpoints on them.\n\n- **`Mod:Fun()`** - Runs the code to be profiled.\n\n- **`cprof:pause/0..3`** - Pauses the call counters for specified functions.\n  This minimises the impact of code running in the background or in the shell\n  that disturbs the profiling. Call counters are automatically paused when they\n  \"hit the ceiling\" of the host machine word size. For a 32 bit host the maximum\n  counter value is 2147483647.\n\n- **`cprof:analyse/0..2`** - Collects call counters and computes the result.\n\n- **`cprof:restart/0..3`** - Restarts the call counters from zero for specified\n  functions.

As for now, BIFs cannot be call count traced.\n\nThe analysis result can either be for all modules, or for one module. In either\ncase a call count limit can be given to filter out the functions with a call\ncount below the limit. The all modules analysis does _not_ contain the module\n`cprof` itself, it can only be analysed by specifying it as a single module to\nanalyse.\n\nCall count tracing is very lightweight compared to other forms of tracing since\nno trace message has to be generated.

The\nmodule is intended to be used from the current running nodes shell. To access\nremote nodes use `lcnt:clear(Node)` and `lcnt:collect(Node)`.\n\nAll locks are continuously monitored and its statistics updated. Use\n`lcnt:clear/0` to initially clear all counters before running any specific\ntests. This command will also reset the duration timer internally.\n\nTo retrieve lock statistics information, use `lcnt:collect/0,1`. The collect\noperation will start a `lcnt` server if it not already started. All collected\ndata will be built into an Erlang term and uploaded to the server and a duration\ntime will also be uploaded. This duration is the time between `lcnt:clear/0,1`\nand `lcnt:collect/0,1`.\n\nOnce the data is collected to the server it can be filtered, sorted and printed\nin many different ways.\n\nSee the [reference manual](`m:lcnt`) for a description of each function.","ref":"lcnt_chapter.html#getting-started"},{"type":"extras","title":"Example of usage - lcnt - The Lock Profiler","doc":"From the Erlang shell:\n\n```text\nErlang R13B03 (erts-5.7.4) [source] [smp:8:8] [rq:8] [async-threads:0] [hipe]\n [kernel-poll:false] [lock-counting]\n1> lcnt:rt_opt({copy_save, true}).\nfalse\n2> lcnt:clear(), big:bang(1000), lcnt:collect().\nok\n3> lcnt:conflicts().\n                   lock   id  #tries  #collisions  collisions [%]  time [us]  duration [%]\n                  -----  --- ------- ------------ --------------- ---------- -------------\n         alcu_allocator   50 4113692       158921          3.8632     215464        4.4962\n               pix_lock  256 4007140         4882          0.1218      12221        0.2550\n              run_queue    8 2287246         6949          0.3038       9825        0.2050\n              proc_main 1029 3115778        25755          0.8266       1199        0.0250\n              proc_msgq 1029 2467022         1910          0.0774       1048        0.0219\n            proc_status 1029 5708439         2435          0.0427        706        0.0147\n message_pre_alloc_lock    8 2008569          134          0.0067         90        0.0019\n              timeofday    1   54065            8          0.0148         22        0.0005\n                gc_info    1    7071            7          0.0990          5        0.0001\nok\n```\n\nAnother way to to profile a specific function is to use `lcnt:apply/3` or\n`lcnt:apply/1` which does `lcnt:clear/0` before the function and\n`lcnt:collect/0` after its invocation.

It does so by analyzing the\ndefined functions and the function calls.\n\nIn order to make Xref easy to use, there are predefined analyses that perform\nsome common tasks. Typically, a module or a release can be checked for calls to\nundefined functions. For the somewhat more advanced user there is a small, but\nrather flexible, language that can be used for selecting parts of the analyzed\nsystem and for doing some simple graph analyses on selected calls.\n\nThe following sections show some features of Xref, beginning with a module check\nand a predefined analysis. Then follow examples that can be skipped on the first\nreading; not all of the concepts used are explained, and it is assumed that the\n[reference manual](`m:xref`) has been at least skimmed.","ref":"xref_chapter.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Module Check - Xref - The Cross Reference Tool","doc":"Assume we want to check the following module:\n\n```text\n    -module(my_module).\n\n    -export([t/1]).\n\n    t(A) ->\n      my_module:t2(A).\n\n    t2(_) ->\n      true.\n```\n\nCross reference data are read from BEAM files, so the first step when checking\nan edited module is to compile it:\n\n```text\n    1> c(my_module, debug_info).\n    ./my_module.erl:10: Warning: function t2/1 is unused\n    {ok, my_module}\n```\n\nThe `debug_info` option ensures that the BEAM file contains debug information,\nwhich makes it possible to find unused local functions.\n\nThe module can now be checked for calls to\n[deprecated functions](`m:xref#deprecated_function`), calls to\n[undefined functions](`m:xref#undefined_function`), and for unused local\nfunctions:\n\n```text\n    2> xref:m(my_module)\n    [{deprecated,[]},\n     {undefined,[{{my_module,t,1},{my_module,t2,1}}]},\n     {unused,[{my_module,t2,1}]}]\n```\n\n`m/1` is also suitable for checking that the BEAM file of a module that is about\nto be loaded into a running a system does not call any undefined functions. In\neither case, the code path of the code server (see the module `code`) is used\nfor finding modules that export externally called functions not exported by the\nchecked module itself, so called [library modules](`m:xref#library_module`).","ref":"xref_chapter.html#module-check"},{"type":"extras","title":"Predefined Analysis - Xref - The Cross Reference Tool","doc":"In the last example the module to analyze was given as an argument to `m/1`, and\nthe code path was (implicitly) used as [library path](`m:xref#library_path`). In\nthis example an [xref server](`m:xref#xref_server`) will be used, which makes it\npossible to analyze applications and releases, and also to select the library\npath explicitly.\n\nEach Xref server is referred to by a unique name. The name is given when\ncreating the server:\n\n```text\n    1> xref:start(s).\n    {ok,<0.27.0>}\n```\n\nNext the system to be analyzed is added to the Xref server. Here the system will\nbe OTP, so no library path will be needed. Otherwise, when analyzing a system\nthat uses OTP, the OTP modules are typically made library modules by setting the\nlibrary path to the default OTP code path (or to `code_path`, see the\n[reference manual](`m:xref#code_path`)). By default, the names of read BEAM\nfiles and warnings are output when adding analyzed modules, but these messages\ncan be avoided by setting default values of some options:\n\n```text\n    2> xref:set_default(s, [{verbose,false}, {warnings,false}]).\n    ok\n    3> xref:add_release(s, code:lib_dir(), {name, otp}).\n    {ok,otp}\n```\n\n`add_release/3` assumes that all subdirectories of the library directory\nreturned by `code:lib_dir()` contain applications; the effect is that of reading\nall applications' BEAM files.\n\nIt is now easy to check the release for calls to undefined functions:\n\n```text\n    4> xref:analyze(s, undefined_function_calls).\n    {ok, [...]}\n```\n\nWe can now continue with further analyses, or we can delete the Xref server:\n\n```text\n    5> xref:stop(s).\n```\n\nThe check for calls to undefined functions is an example of a predefined\nanalysis, probably the most useful one. Other examples are the analyses that\nfind unused local functions, or functions that call some given functions. See\nthe [analyze/2,3](`m:xref#analyze`) functions for a complete list of predefined\nanalyses.\n\nEach predefined analysis is a shorthand for a [query](`m:xref#query`), a\nsentence of a tiny language providing cross reference data as values of\n[predefined variables](`m:xref#predefined_variable`). The check for calls to\nundefined functions can thus be stated as a query:\n\n```text\n    4> xref:q(s, \"(XC - UC) || (XU - X - B)\").\n    {ok,[...]}\n```\n\nThe query asks for the restriction of external calls except the unresolved calls\nto calls to functions that are externally used but neither exported nor built-in\nfunctions (the `||` operator restricts the used functions while the `|` operator\nrestricts the calling functions). The `-` operator returns the difference of two\nsets, and the `+` operator to be used below returns the union of two sets.\n\nThe relationships between the predefined variables `XU`, `X`, `B` and a few\nothers are worth elaborating upon. The reference manual mentions two ways of\nexpressing the set of all functions, one that focuses on how they are defined:\n`X + L + B + U`, and one that focuses on how they are used: `UU + LU + XU`. The\nreference also mentions some [facts](`m:xref#simple_facts`) about the variables:\n\n- `F` is equal to `L + X` (the defined functions are the local functions and the\n  external functions);\n- `U` is a subset of `XU` (the unknown functions are a subset of the externally\n  used functions since the compiler ensures that locally used functions are\n  defined);\n- `B` is a subset of `XU` (calls to built-in functions are always external by\n  definition, and unused built-in functions are ignored);\n- `LU` is a subset of `F` (the locally used functions are either local functions\n  or exported functions, again ensured by the compiler);\n- `UU` is equal to `F - (XU + LU)` (the unused functions are defined functions\n  that are neither used externally nor locally);\n- `UU` is a subset of `F` (the unused functions are defined in analyzed\n  modules).\n\nUsing these facts, the two small circles in the picture below can be combined.\n\n![Definition and use of functions](assets/venn1.gif \"Definition and use of functions\")\n\nIt is often clarifying to mark the variables of a query in such a circle. This\nis illustrated in the picture below for some of the predefined analyses. Note\nthat local functions used by local functions only are not marked in the\n`locals_not_used` circle.[](){: id=venn2 }\n\n![Some predefined analyses as subsets of all functions](assets/venn2.gif \"Some predefined analyses as subsets of all functions\")","ref":"xref_chapter.html#predefined-analysis"},{"type":"extras","title":"Expressions - Xref - The Cross Reference Tool","doc":"The module check and the predefined analyses are useful, but limited.

The restriction operators (`|`, `||` and `|||`) are the only\noperators that accept both representations. This means that in order to analyze\nindirect calls using restriction, the `closure` operator (which creates the\n`digraph` representation of graphs) has to be applied explicitly.\n\nAs an example of analyzing indirect calls, the following Erlang function tries\nto answer the question: if we want to know which modules are used indirectly by\nsome module(s), is it worth while using the\n[function graph](`m:xref#call_graph`) rather than the module graph? Recall that\na module M1 is said to call a module M2 if there is some function in M1 that\ncalls some function in M2. It would be nice if we could use the much smaller\nmodule graph, since it is available also in the light weight\n`modules`[mode](`m:xref#mode`) of Xref servers.\n\n```erlang\n    t(S) ->\n      {ok, _} = xref:q(S, \"Eplus := closure E\"),\n      {ok, Ms} = xref:q(S, \"AM\"),\n      Fun = fun(M, N) ->\n          Q = io_lib:format(\"# (Mod) (Eplus | ~p : Mod)\", [M]),\n          {ok, N0} = xref:q(S, lists:flatten(Q)),\n          N + N0\n        end,\n      Sum = lists:foldl(Fun, 0, Ms),\n      ok = xref:forget(S, 'Eplus'),\n      {ok, Tot} = xref:q(S, \"# (closure ME | AM)\"),\n      100 * ((Tot - Sum) / Tot).\n```\n\nComments on the code:\n\n- We want to find the reduction of the closure of the function graph to modules.\n  The direct expression for doing that would be `(Mod) (closure E | AM)`, but\n  then we would have to represent all of the transitive closure of E in memory.\n  Instead the number of indirectly used modules is found for each analyzed\n  module, and the sum over all modules is calculated.\n- A user variable is employed for holding the `digraph` representation of the\n  function graph for use in many queries. The reason is efficiency. As opposed\n  to the `=` operator, the `:=` operator saves a value for subsequent analyses.\n  Here might be the place to note that equal subexpressions within a query are\n  evaluated only once; `=` cannot be used for speeding things up.\n- `Eplus | ~p : Mod`. The `|` operator converts the second operand to the type\n  of the first operand. In this case the module is converted to all functions of\n  the module. It is necessary to assign a type to the module (`: Mod`),\n  otherwise modules like `kernel` would be converted to all functions of the\n  application with the same name; the most general constant is used in cases of\n  ambiguity.\n- Since we are only interested in a ratio, the unary operator `#` that counts\n  the elements of the operand is used. It cannot be applied to the `digraph`\n  representation of graphs.\n- We could find the size of the closure of the module graph with a loop similar\n  to one used for the function graph, but since the module graph is so much\n  smaller, a more direct method is feasible.\n\nWhen the Erlang function `t/1` was applied to an Xref server loaded with the\ncurrent version of OTP, the returned value was close to 84 (percent). This means\nthat the number of indirectly used modules is approximately six times greater\nwhen using the module graph. So the answer to the above stated question is that\nit is definitely worth while using the function graph for this particular\nanalysis. Finally, note that in the presence of unresolved calls, the graphs may\nbe incomplete, which means that there may be indirectly used modules that do not\nshow up.","ref":"xref_chapter.html#graph-analysis"},{"type":"extras","title":"Erlang mode for Emacs","doc":"# Erlang mode for Emacs\n\nPossibly the most important feature of an editor designed for programmers is the\nability to indent a line of code in accordance with the structure of the\nprogramming language.

<p>A Time Profiling Tool using trace to file for minimal runtime performance
impact.</p><p>This module is used to profile a program to find out how the execution time is
used. Trace to file is used to minimize runtime performance impact.</p><p>The <code class="inline">fprof</code> module uses tracing to collect profiling data, hence there is no
need for special compilation of any module to be profiled. When it starts
tracing, <code class="inline">fprof</code> will erase all previous tracing in the node and set the
necessary trace flags on the profiling target processes as well as local call
trace on all functions in all loaded modules and all modules to be loaded.
<code class="inline">fprof</code> erases all tracing in the node when it stops tracing.</p><p><code class="inline">fprof</code> presents both <em>own time</em> i.e how much time a function has used for its
own execution, and <em>accumulated time</em> i.e including called functions. All
presented times are collected using trace timestamps. <code class="inline">fprof</code> tries to collect
cpu time timestamps, if the host machine OS supports it. Therefore the times may
be wallclock times and OS scheduling will randomly strike all called functions
in a presumably fair way.</p><p>If, however, the profiling time is short, and the host machine OS does not
support high resolution cpu time measurements, some few OS schedulings may show
up as ridiculously long execution times for functions doing practically nothing.
An example of a function more or less just composing a tuple in about 100 times
the normal execution time has been seen, and when the tracing was repeated, the
execution time became normal.</p><p>Profiling is essentially done in 3 steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong><code class="inline">1</code></strong> - Tracing; to file, as mentioned in the previous paragraph. The trace
contains entries for function calls, returns to function, process scheduling,
other process related (spawn, etc) events, and garbage collection. All trace
entries are timestamped.</p></li><li><p><strong><code class="inline">2</code></strong> - Profiling; the trace file is read, the execution call stack is
simulated, and raw profile data is calculated from the simulated call stack
and the trace timestamps. The profile data is stored in the <code class="inline">fprof</code> server
state. During this step the trace data may be dumped in text format to file or
console.</p></li><li><p><strong><code class="inline">3</code></strong> - Analysing; the raw profile data is sorted, filtered and dumped in
text format either to file or console. The text format intended to be both
readable for a human reader, as well as parsable with the standard erlang
parsing tools.</p></li></ul><p>Since <code class="inline">fprof</code> uses trace to file, the runtime performance degradation is
minimized, but still far from negligible, especially for programs that use the
filesystem heavily by themselves. Where you place the trace file is also
important, e.g on Solaris <code class="inline">/tmp</code> is usually a good choice since it is
essentially a RAM disk, while any NFS (network) mounted disk is a bad idea.</p><p><code class="inline">fprof</code> can also skip the file step and trace to a tracer process that does the
profiling in runtime.</p><p><a href="" id="analysis"></a></p><h2 id="module-analysis-format" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#module-analysis-format" class="hover-link">
    <i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
  <span class="text">Analysis format</span>
</h2>
<p>This section describes the output format of the analyse command. See
<a href="#analyse/0"><code class="inline">analyse/0</code></a>.</p><p>The format is parsable with the standard Erlang parsing tools <code class="inline">erl_scan</code> and
<code class="inline">erl_parse</code>, <a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#consult/1"><code class="inline">file:consult/1</code></a> or <a href="../../../../lib/stdlib/doc/html/io.html#read/2"><code class="inline">io:read/2</code></a>. The parse format is not explained
here - it should be easy for the interested to try it out. Note that some flags
to <a href="#analyse/1"><code class="inline">analyse/1</code></a> will affect the format.</p><p>The following example was run on OTP/R8 on Solaris 8, all OTP internals in this
example are very version dependent.</p><p>As an example, we will use the following function, that you may recognise as a
slightly modified benchmark function from the manpage file(3):</p><pre><code class="text">-module(foo).
-export([create_file_slow/2]).

create_file_slow(Name, N) when is_integer(N), N &gt;= 0 -&gt;
    {ok, FD} =
        file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),
    if N &gt; 256 -&gt;
            ok = file:write(FD,
                            lists:map(fun (X) -&gt; &lt;&lt;X:32/unsigned&gt;&gt; end,
                            lists:seq(0, 255))),
            ok = create_file_slow(FD, 256, N);
       true -&gt;
            ok = create_file_slow(FD, 0, N)
    end,
    ok = file:close(FD).

create_file_slow(FD, M, M) -&gt;
    ok;
create_file_slow(FD, M, N) -&gt;
    ok = file:write(FD, &lt;&lt;M:32/unsigned&gt;&gt;),
    create_file_slow(FD, M+1, N).</code></pre><p>Let us have a look at the printout after running:</p><pre><code class="text">1&gt; fprof:apply(foo, create_file_slow, [junk, 1024]).
2&gt; fprof:profile().
3&gt; fprof:analyse().</code></pre><p>The printout starts with:</p><pre><code class="text">%% Analysis results:
{  analysis_options,
 [{callers, true},
  {sort, acc},
  {totals, false},
  {details, true}]}.

%                                       CNT       ACC       OWN
[{ totals,                             9627, 1691.119, 1659.074}].  %%%</code></pre><p>The CNT column shows the total number of function calls that was found in the
trace. In the ACC column is the total time of the trace from first timestamp to
last. And in the OWN column is the sum of the execution time in functions found
in the trace, not including called functions. In this case it is very close to
the ACC time since the emulator had practically nothing else to do than to
execute our test program.</p><p>All time values in the printout are in milliseconds.</p><p>The printout continues:</p><pre><code class="text">%                                       CNT       ACC       OWN
[{ &quot;&lt;0.28.0&gt;&quot;,                         9627,undefined, 1659.074}].   %%</code></pre><p>This is the printout header of one process. The printout contains only this one
process since we did <a href="#apply/3"><code class="inline">fprof:apply/3</code></a> which traces only the current process.
Therefore the CNT and OWN columns perfectly matches the totals above. The ACC
column is undefined since summing the ACC times of all calls in the process
makes no sense - you would get something like the ACC value from totals above
multiplied by the average depth of the call stack, or something.</p><p>All paragraphs up to the next process header only concerns function calls within
this process.</p><p>Now we come to something more interesting:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{undefined,                             0, 1691.076,    0.030}],
 { {fprof,apply_start_stop,4},            0, 1691.076,    0.030},     %
 [{{foo,create_file_slow,2},              1, 1691.046,    0.103},
  {suspend,                               1,    0.000,    0.000}]}.

{[{{fprof,apply_start_stop,4},            1, 1691.046,    0.103}],
 { {foo,create_file_slow,2},              1, 1691.046,    0.103},     %
 [{{file,close,1},                        1, 1398.873,    0.019},
  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},              1,  249.678,    0.029},
  {{file,open,2},                         1,   20.778,    0.055},
  {{lists,map,2},                         1,   16.590,    0.043},
  {{lists,seq,2},                         1,    4.708,    0.017},
  {{file,write,2},                        1,    0.316,    0.021}]}.</code></pre><p>The printout consists of one paragraph per called function. The function
<em>marked</em> with '%' is the one the paragraph concerns - <code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/2</code>.
Above the marked function are the <em>calling</em> functions - those that has called
the marked, and below are those <em>called</em> by the marked function.</p><p>The paragraphs are per default sorted in decreasing order of the ACC column for
the marked function. The calling list and called list within one paragraph are
also per default sorted in decreasing order of their ACC column.</p><p>The columns are: CNT - the number of times the function has been called, ACC -
the time spent in the function including called functions, and OWN - the time
spent in the function not including called functions.</p><p>The rows for the <em>calling</em> functions contain statistics for the <em>marked</em>
function with the constraint that only the occasions when a call was made from
the <em>row's</em> function to the <em>marked</em> function are accounted for.</p><p>The row for the <em>marked</em> function simply contains the sum of all <em>calling</em> rows.</p><p>The rows for the <em>called</em> functions contains statistics for the <em>row's</em> function
with the constraint that only the occasions when a call was made from the
<em>marked</em> to the <em>row's</em> function are accounted for.</p><p>So, we see that <code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/2</code> used very little time for its own
execution. It spent most of its time in <a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#close/1"><code class="inline">file:close/1</code></a>. The function
<code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/3</code> that writes 3/4 of the file contents is the second
biggest time thief.</p><p>We also see that the call to <a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#write/2"><code class="inline">file:write/2</code></a> that writes 1/4 of the file contents
takes very little time in itself. What takes time is to build the data
(<a href="../../../../lib/stdlib/doc/html/lists.html#seq/2"><code class="inline">lists:seq/2</code></a> and <a href="../../../../lib/stdlib/doc/html/lists.html#map/2"><code class="inline">lists:map/2</code></a>).</p><p>The function 'undefined' that has called <code class="inline">fprof:apply_start_stop/4</code> is an
unknown function because that call was not recorded in the trace. It was only
recorded that the execution returned from <code class="inline">fprof:apply_start_stop/4</code> to some
other function above in the call stack, or that the process exited from there.</p><p>Let us continue down the printout to find:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{foo,create_file_slow,2},              1,  249.678,    0.029},
  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},            768,    0.000,   23.294}],
 { {foo,create_file_slow,3},            769,  249.678,   23.323},     %
 [{{file,write,2},                      768,  220.314,   14.539},
  {suspend,                              57,    6.041,    0.000},
  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},            768,    0.000,   23.294}]}.</code></pre><p>If you compare with the code you will see there also that
<code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/3</code> was called only from <code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/2</code> and
itself, and called only <a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#write/2"><code class="inline">file:write/2</code></a>, note the number of calls to
<a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#write/2"><code class="inline">file:write/2</code></a>. But here we see that <code class="inline">suspend</code> was called a few times. This is a
pseudo function that indicates that the process was suspended while executing in
<code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/3</code>, and since there is no <code class="inline">receive</code> or <a href="../../../../lib/../erts/doc/html/erlang.html#yield/0"><code class="inline">erlang:yield/0</code></a> in
the code, it must be Erlang scheduling suspensions, or the trace file driver
compensating for large file write operations (these are regarded as a schedule
out followed by a schedule in to the same process).</p><p>Let us find the <code class="inline">suspend</code> entry:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{file,write,2},                       53,    6.281,    0.000},
  {{foo,create_file_slow,3},             57,    6.041,    0.000},
  {{prim_file,drv_command,4},            50,    4.582,    0.000},
  {{prim_file,drv_get_response,1},       34,    2.986,    0.000},

  {{prim_file,write,2},                  17,    1.852,    0.000},
  {{erlang,port_command,2},              15,    1.713,    0.000},

 [ ]}.</code></pre><p>We find no particularly long suspend times, so no function seems to have waited
in a receive statement. Actually, <code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/4</code> contains a receive
statement, but in this test program, the message lies in the process receive
buffer when the receive statement is entered. We also see that the total suspend
time for the test run is small.</p><p>The <code class="inline">suspend</code> pseudo function has got an OWN time of zero. This is to prevent
the process total OWN time from including time in suspension. Whether suspend
time is really ACC or OWN time is more of a philosophical question.</p><p>Now we look at another interesting pseudo function, <code class="inline">garbage_collect</code>:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{prim_file,drv_command,4},            25,    0.873,    0.873},
  {{prim_file,write,2},                  16,    0.692,    0.692},
  {{lists,map,2},                         2,    0.195,    0.195}],
 { garbage_collect,                      43,    1.760,    1.760},     %
 [ ]}.</code></pre><p>Here we see that no function distinguishes itself considerably, which is very
normal.</p><p>The <code class="inline">garbage_collect</code> pseudo function has not got an OWN time of zero like
<code class="inline">suspend</code>, instead it is equal to the ACC time.</p><p>Garbage collect often occurs while a process is suspended, but <code class="inline">fprof</code> hides
this fact by pretending that the suspended function was first unsuspended and
then garbage collected. Otherwise the printout would show <code class="inline">garbage_collect</code>
being called from <code class="inline">suspend</code> but not which function that might have caused the
garbage collection.</p><p>Let us now get back to the test code:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{foo,create_file_slow,3},            768,  220.314,   14.539},
  {{foo,create_file_slow,2},              1,    0.316,    0.021}],

 [{{prim_file,write,2},                 769,  199.789,   22.573},
  {suspend,                              53,    6.281,    0.000}]}.</code></pre><p>Not unexpectedly, we see that <a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#write/2"><code class="inline">file:write/2</code></a> was called from
<code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/3</code> and <code class="inline">foo:create_file_slow/2</code>. The number of calls in
each case as well as the used time are also just confirms the previous results.</p><p>We see that <a href="../../../../lib/kernel/doc/html/file.html#write/2"><code class="inline">file:write/2</code></a> only calls <code class="inline">prim_file:write/2</code>, but let us refrain
from digging into the internals of the kernel application.</p><p>But, if we nevertheless <em>do</em> dig down we find the call to the linked in driver
that does the file operations towards the host operating system:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{prim_file,drv_command,4},           772, 1458.356, 1456.643}],
 { {erlang,port_command,2},             772, 1458.356, 1456.643},     %
 [{suspend,                              15,    1.713,    0.000}]}.</code></pre><p>This is 86 % of the total run time, and as we saw before it is the close
operation the absolutely biggest contributor. We find a comparison ratio a
little bit up in the call stack:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{prim_file,close,1},                   1, 1398.748,    0.024},
  {{prim_file,write,2},                 769,  174.672,   12.810},
  {{prim_file,open_int,4},                1,   19.755,    0.017},
  {{prim_file,open_int_setopts,3},        1,    0.147,    0.016}],

 [{{prim_file,drv_command,4},           772, 1578.973,   27.265},
  {suspend,                              22,    1.482,    0.000}]}.</code></pre><p>The time for file operations in the linked in driver distributes itself as 1 %
for open, 11 % for write and 87 % for close. All data is probably buffered in
the operating system until the close.</p><p>The unsleeping reader may notice that the ACC times for
<code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/2</code> and <code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/4</code> is not equal between the
paragraphs above, even though it is easy to believe that
<code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/2</code> is just a passthrough function.</p><p>The missing time can be found in the paragraph for <code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/4</code>
where it is evident that not only <code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/2</code> is called but also a
fun:</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{prim_file,drv_command,2},           772, 1578.973,   27.265}],
 { {prim_file,drv_command,4},           772, 1578.973,   27.265},     %
 [{{erlang,port_command,2},             772, 1458.356, 1456.643},
  {{prim_file,'-drv_command/2-fun-0-',1}, 772,   87.897,   12.736},
  {suspend,                              50,    4.582,    0.000},
  {garbage_collect,                      25,    0.873,    0.873}]}.</code></pre><p>And some more missing time can be explained by the fact that
<code class="inline">prim_file:open_int/4</code> both calls <code class="inline">prim_file:drv_command/2</code> directly as well as
through <code class="inline">prim_file:open_int_setopts/3</code>, which complicates the picture.</p><pre><code class="text">{[{{prim_file,open,2},                    1,   20.309,    0.029},

<p>The actual supervision of execution times is in itself a CPU intensive activity.
A message is written on the trace file for every function call that is made by
the profiled code.</p><p>The ACC time calculation is sometimes difficult to make correct, since it is
difficult to define. This happens especially when a function occurs in several
instances in the call stack, for example by calling itself perhaps through other
functions and perhaps even non-tail recursively.</p><p>To produce sensible results, <code class="inline">fprof</code> tries not to charge any function more than
once for ACC time. The instance highest up (with longest duration) in the call
stack is chosen.</p><p>Sometimes a function may unexpectedly waste a lot (some 10 ms or more depending
on host machine OS) of OWN (and ACC) time, even functions that do practically
nothing at all. The problem may be that the OS has chosen to schedule out the
Erlang runtime system process for a while, and if the OS does not support high
resolution cpu time measurements <code class="inline">fprof</code> will use wallclock time for its
calculations, and it will appear as functions randomly burn virtual machine
time.</p><h2 id="module-see-also" class="section-heading">

Either option <code class="inline">start</code> or <code class="inline">stop</code> must be specified, but not both.</p></li><li><p><strong><code class="inline">verbose</code> | <code class="inline">{verbose, boolean()}</code></strong> - The options <code class="inline">verbose</code> or
<code class="inline">{verbose, true}</code> adds some trace flags that <code class="inline">fprof</code> does not need, but that
may be interesting for general debugging purposes. This option is only allowed
with the <code class="inline">start</code> option.</p></li><li><p><strong><code class="inline">cpu_time</code> | <code class="inline">{cpu_time, boolean()}</code></strong> - The options <code class="inline">cpu_time</code> or
<code class="inline">{cpu_time, true}</code> makes the timestamps in the trace be in CPU time instead of
wallclock time which is the default. This option is only allowed with the
<code class="inline">start</code> option.</p><blockquote><h4 class="warning">Warning</h4><p>Getting correct values out of cpu_time can be difficult. The best way to get
correct values is to run using a single scheduler and bind that scheduler to
a specific CPU, i.e. <code class="inline">erl +S 1 +sbt db</code>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong><code class="inline">{procs, PidSpec}</code> | <code class="inline">{procs, [PidSpec]}</code></strong> - Specifies which processes that
shall be traced. If this option is not given, the calling process is traced.
All processes spawned by the traced processes are also traced. This option is
only allowed with the <code class="inline">start</code> option.</p></li><li><p><strong><code class="inline">file</code> | <code class="inline">{file, Filename}</code></strong> - Specifies the filename of the trace. If the
option <code class="inline">file</code> is given, or none of these options are given, the file
<code class="inline">&quot;fprof.trace&quot;</code> is used. This option is only allowed with the <code class="inline">start</code> option,

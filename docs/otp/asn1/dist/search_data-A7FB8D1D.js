For each ASN.1 value defined in the module, an Erlang function\nthat returns the value in Erlang representation is generated.\n\nIf `Asn1module` is a filename without extension, first `\".asn1\"` is assumed,\nthen `\".asn\"`, and finally `\".py\"` (to be compatible with the old ASN.1\ncompiler). `Asn1module` can be a full pathname (relative or absolute) including\nfilename with (or without) extension.[](){: id=asn1set }\n\nIf it is needed to compile a set of `ASN.1` modules into an Erlang file with\nencode/decode functions, ensure to list all involved files in a configuration\nfile. This configuration file must have a double extension `\".set.asn\"`\n(`\".asn\"` can alternatively be `\".asn1\"` or `\".py\"`). List the input file names\nwithin quotation marks (\"\"), one at each row in the file. If the input files are\n`File1.asn`, `File2.asn`, and `File3.asn`, the configuration file must look as\nfollows:\n\n```text\nFile1.asn\nFile2.asn\nFile3.asn\n```\n\nThe output files in this case get their names from the configuration file. If\nthe configuration file is named `SetOfFiles.set.asn`, the names of the output\nfiles are `SetOfFiles.hrl, SetOfFiles.erl, and SetOfFiles.asn1db`.\n\nSometimes in a system of `ASN.1` modules, different default tag modes, for\nexample, `AUTOMATIC`, `IMPLICIT`, or `EXPLICIT`. The multi-file compilation\nresolves the default tagging as if the modules were compiled separately.\n\nName collisions is another unwanted effect that can occur in multi\nfile-compilation. The compiler solves this problem in one of two ways:\n\n- If the definitions are identical, the output module keeps only one definition\n  with the original name.\n- If the definitions have the same name and differs in the definition, they are\n  renamed. The new names are the definition name and the original module name\n  concatenated.\n\nIf a name collision occurs, the compiler reports a `\"NOTICE: ...\"` message that\ntells if a definition was renamed, and the new name that must be used to\nencode/decode data.\n\n`Options` is a list with options specific for the `ASN.1` compiler and options\nthat are applied to the Erlang compiler. The latter are not recognized as\n`ASN.1` specific. The available options are as follows:\n\n- **`ber | per | uper | jer`** - The encoding rule to be used. The supported\n  encoding rules are Basic Encoding Rules (`ber`), Packed Encoding Rules (`per`)\n  aligned, PER unaligned (`uper`) and JSON Encoding Rules (`jer`). The `jer`\n  option can be used by itself to generate a module that only supports\n  encoding/decoding to JER or it can be used as a supplementary option to ber,\n  per and uper. In the latter case a module with for both the main encoding\n  rules and JER will be generated. The exported functions for JER will then be\n  `jer_encode(Type, Value)` and `jer_decode(Type, Bytes)`.\n\n  The `jer` encoding rules (ITU-T X.697) are experimental in OTP 22. There is\n  support for a subset of the X.697 standard, for example there is no support\n  for:\n\n  - JER encoding instructions\n  - the REAL type\n\n  Also note that when using the `jer` encoding rules the generated module will\n  get a dependency to an external json component. The generated code is\n  currently tested together with:\n\n  - `jsx` which currently is the default.\n  - `jsone` can be chosen instead of `jsx` by providing the option `{d,jsone}`.\n\n  If the encoding rule option is omitted, `ber` is the default.\n\n  The generated Erlang module always gets the same name as the `ASN.1` module.\n  Therefore, only one encoding rule per `ASN.1` module can be used at runtime.\n\n- **`der`** - With this option the Distinguished Encoding Rules (`der`) is\n  chosen. DER is regarded as a specialized variant of the BER encoding rule.\n  Therefore, this option only makes sense together with option `ber`. This\n  option sometimes adds sorting and value checks when encoding, which implies a\n  slower encoding. The decoding routines are the same as for `ber`.\n\n- **`maps`** - This option changes the representation of the types `SEQUENCE`\n  and `SET` to use maps (instead of records). This option also suppresses the\n  generation of `.hrl` files.\n\n  For details, see Section\n  [Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET](asn1_getting_started.md#map_seq_set)\n  in the User's Guide.\n\n- **`compact_bit_string`** - The `BIT STRING` type is decoded to \"compact\n  notation\". _This option is not recommended for new code._ This option cannot\n  be combined with the option `maps`.\n\n  For details, see Section [BIT STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#bit-string) in\n  the User's Guide.\n\n  This option implies option `legacy_erlang_types`.\n\n- **`legacy_bit_string`** - The `BIT STRING` type is decoded to the legacy\n  format, that is, a list of zeroes and ones. _This option is not recommended\n  for new code._ This option cannot be combined with the option `maps`.\n\n  For details, see Section [BIT STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#bit-string) in\n  the User's Guide\n\n  This option implies option `legacy_erlang_types`.\n\n- **`legacy_erlang_types`** - Use the same Erlang types to represent\n  `BIT STRING` and `OCTET STRING` as in OTP R16.\n\n  For details, see Section [BIT STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#bit-string) and\n  Section [OCTET STRING](asn1_getting_started.md#octet-string) in the User's\n  Guide.\n\n  _This option is not recommended for new code._ This option cannot be combined\n  with the option `maps`.\n\n- **`{n2n, EnumTypeName}`** - Tells the compiler to generate functions for\n  conversion between names (as atoms) and numbers and conversely for the\n  specified `EnumTypeName`. There can be multiple occurrences of this option to\n  specify several type names. The type names must be declared as `ENUMERATIONS`\n  in the ASN.1 specification.\n\n  If `EnumTypeName` does not exist in the ASN.1 specification, the compilation\n  stops with an error code.\n\n  The generated conversion functions are named `name2num_EnumTypeName/1` and\n  `num2name_EnumTypeName/1`.\n\n- **`noobj`** - Do not compile (that is, do not produce object code) the\n  generated `.erl` file. If this option is omitted, the generated Erlang module\n  is compiled.\n\n- **`{i, IncludeDir}`** - Adds `IncludeDir` to the search-path for `.asn1db` and\n  `ASN.1` source files. The compiler tries to open an `.asn1db` file when a\n  module imports definitions from another `ASN.1` module. If no `.asn1db` file\n  is found, the `ASN.1` source file is parsed. Several `{i, IncludeDir}` can be\n  given.\n\n- **`{outdir, Dir}`** - Specifies directory `Dir` where all generated files are\n  to be placed. If this option is omitted, the files are placed in the current\n  directory.\n\n- **`asn1config`** - When using one of the specialized decodes, exclusive or\n  selective decode, instructions must be given in a configuration file. Option\n  `asn1config` enables specialized decodes and takes the configuration file in\n  concern. The configuration file has the same name as the ASN.1 specification,\n  but with extension `.asn1config`.\n\n  For instructions for exclusive decode, see Section\n  [Exclusive Decode](asn1_spec.md#exclusive-instruction) in the User's Guide.\n\n  For instructions for selective decode, see Section\n  [Selective Decode](asn1_spec.md#selective-instruction) in the User's Guide.\n\n- **`undec_rest`** - A buffer that holds a message, being decoded it can also\n  have some following bytes. Those following bytes can now be returned together\n  with the decoded value. If an ASN.1 specification is compiled with this\n  option, a tuple `{ok, Value, Rest}` is returned. `Rest` can be a list or a\n  binary. Earlier versions of the compiler ignored those following bytes.\n\n- **`no_ok_wrapper`** - With this option, the generated `encode/2` and\n  `decode/2` functions do not wrap a successful return value in an `{ok,...}`\n  tuple. If any error occurs, an exception will be raised.\n\n- **`{macro_name_prefix, Prefix}`** - All macro names generated by the compiler\n  are prefixed with `Prefix`. This is useful when multiple protocols that\n  contain macros with identical names are included in a single module.\n\n- **`{record_name_prefix, Prefix}`** - All record names generated by the\n  compiler are prefixed with `Prefix`. This is useful when multiple protocols\n  that contain records with identical names are included in a single module.\n\n- **`verbose`** - Causes more verbose information from the compiler describing\n  what it is doing.\n\n- **`warnings_as_errors`** - Causes warnings to be treated as errors.\n\n- **`deterministic`** - Causes all non-deterministic options to be stripped from\n  the -asn1_info() attribute.\n\nAny more option that is applied is passed to the final step when the generated\n`.erl` file is compiled.\n\nThe compiler generates the following files:\n\n- `Asn1module.hrl` (if any `SET` or `SEQUENCE` is defined)\n- `Asn1module.erl` \\- Erlang module with encode, decode, and value functions\n- `Asn1module.asn1db` \\- Intermediate format used by the compiler when modules\n  `IMPORT` definitions from each other.","ref":"asn1ct.html#compile/2"},{"type":"function","title":"asn1ct.test/1","doc":"","ref":"asn1ct.html#test/1"},{"type":"function","title":"asn1ct.test/2","doc":"","ref":"asn1ct.html#test/2"},{"type":"function","title":"asn1ct.test/3","doc":"Performs a test of encode and decode of types in `Module`.

The old cross compilation support\n    was more or less non-existing as well as broken. Please, note that the cross\n    compilation support should still be considered as experimental. Also note\n    that old cross compilation configurations cannot be used without\n    modifications. For more information on cross compiling Erlang/OTP see the\n    `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md` file.\n  - Support for staged install using\n    [DESTDIR](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html). The old\n    broken `INSTALL_PREFIX` has also been fixed. For more information see the\n    `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md` file.\n  - Documentation of the `release` target of the top `Makefile`. For more\n    information see the `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md` file.\n  - `make install` now by default creates relative symbolic links instead of\n    absolute ones. For more information see the `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md` file.\n  - `$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive` now works and prints help for all\n    applications with `configure` scripts.\n  - Doing `make install`, or `make release` directly after `make all` no longer\n    triggers miscellaneous rebuilds.\n  - Existing bootstrap system is now used when doing `make install`, or\n    `make release` without a preceding `make all`.\n  - The `crypto` and `ssl` applications use the same runtime library path when\n    dynamically linking against `libssl.so` and `libcrypto.so`. The runtime\n    library search path has also been extended.\n  - The `configure` scripts of `erl_interface` and `odbc` now search for thread\n    libraries and thread library quirks the same way as ERTS do.\n  - The `configure` script of the `odbc` application now also looks for odbc\n    libraries in `lib64` and `lib/64` directories when building on a 64-bit\n    system.\n  - The `config.h.in` file in the `erl_interface` application is now\n    automatically generated in instead of statically updated which reduces the\n    risk of `configure` tests without any effect.\n\n  (Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and testing)\n\n  (Thanks to Winston Smith for the AVR32-Linux cross configuration and testing)\n\n  \\*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \\***\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8323\n\n- Add support for prefixing macro names generated by the compiler\n\n  This is useful when multiple protocols that contains macros with identical\n  names are included in a single module.\n\n  Add the missing `record_name_prefix` compiler option to the documentation.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8453\n\n- Cleanups suggested by tidier and modernization of types and specs.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8455\n\n- Support for `EXTENSIBILITY IMPLIED` and `SET/SEQ OF NamedType` is added.\n\n  Own Id: OTP-8463","ref":"notes.html#improvements-and-new-features"},{"type":"extras","title":"Asn1 1.6.12 - asn1 Release Notes","doc":"#","ref":"notes.html#asn1-1-6-12"},{"type":"extras","title":"Improvements and New Features - asn1 Release Notes","doc":"- The documentation is now built with open source tools (xsltproc and fop) that\n  exists on most platforms.

The generated Erlang code is compiled using the Erlang\ncompiler and loaded into the Erlang runtime system. There is now an API for\n`encode/2` and `decode/2` in module `People`, which is called like:  \n`'People':encode( ,  )`  \nor  \n`'People':decode( ,  )`\n\nAssume that there is a network application that receives instances of the ASN.1\ndefined type `Person`, modifies, and sends them back again:\n\n```text\nreceive\n   {Port,{data,Bytes}} ->\n       case 'People':decode('Person',Bytes) of\n           {ok,P} ->\n               {ok,Answer} = 'People':encode('Person',mk_answer(P)),\n               Port ! {self(),{command,Answer}};\n           {error,Reason} ->\n               exit({error,Reason})\n       end\n    end,\n```\n\nIn this example, a series of bytes is received from an external source and the\nbytes are then decoded into a valid Erlang term. This was achieved with the call\n`'People':decode('Person',Bytes)`, which returned an Erlang value of the ASN.1\ntype `Person`. Then an answer was constructed and encoded using\n`'People':encode('Person',Answer)`, which takes an instance of a defined ASN.1\ntype and transforms it to a binary according to the BER or PER encoding rules.\n\nThe encoder and decoder can also be run from the shell:\n\n```text\n2> Rockstar = {'Person',\"Some Name\",roving,50}.\n{'Person',\"Some Name\",roving,50}\n3> {ok,Bin} = 'People':encode('Person',Rockstar).\n{ok,<<243,17,19,9,83,111,109,101,32,78,97,109,101,2,1,2,\n      2,1,50>>}\n4> {ok,Person} = 'People':decode('Person',Bin).\n{ok,{'Person',\"Some Name\",roving,50}}\n5>\n```\n\n#","ref":"asn1_getting_started.html#example"},{"type":"extras","title":"Module Dependencies - Getting Started","doc":"It is common that ASN.1 modules import defined types, values, and other entities\nfrom another ASN.1 module.\n\nEarlier versions of the ASN.1 compiler required that modules that were imported\nfrom had to be compiled before the module that imported.

A\n`SEQUENCE` can be defined as follows:\n\n```text\nPdu ::= SEQUENCE {\n   a INTEGER,\n   b REAL,\n   c OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n   d NULL }\n```\n\nThis is a 4-component structure called `Pdu`. By default, a `SEQUENCE` is\nrepresented by a record in Erlang. It can also be represented as a map; see\n[Map representation for SEQUENCE and SET](asn1_getting_started.md#map_seq_set).\nFor each `SEQUENCE` and `SET` in an ASN.1 module an Erlang record declaration is\ngenerated. For `Pdu`, a record like the following is defined:\n\n```text\n-record('Pdu',{a, b, c, d}).\n```\n\nThe record declarations for a module `M` are placed in a separate `M.hrl` file.\n\nValues can be assigned in Erlang as follows:\n\n```text\nMyPdu = #'Pdu'{a=22,b=77.99,c={0,1,2,3,4},d='NULL'}.\n```\n\nThe decode functions return a record as result when decoding a `SEQUENCE` or a\n`SET`.\n\nA `SEQUENCE` and a `SET` can contain a component with a `DEFAULT` keyword\nfollowed by the actual value, which is the default value. The `DEFAULT` keyword\nmeans that the application doing the encoding can omit encoding of the value,\nwhich results in fewer bytes to send to the receiving application.\n\nAn application can use the atom `asn1_DEFAULT` to indicate that the encoding is\nto be omitted for that position in the `SEQUENCE`.\n\nDepending on the encoding rules, the encoder can also compare the given value to\nthe default value and automatically omit the encoding if the values are equal.\nHow much effort the encoder makes to compare the values depends on the encoding\nrules.

However, the value\n`#'StartMessage'{msgId=\"remote\", content=\"Some String\"}` is illegal as the\nconstraint in `StartMessage` tells that when you have chosen a value from a\nspecific object in object set `GENERAL-PROCEDURES` in field `msgId`, you must\nchoose a value from that same object in the content field too.

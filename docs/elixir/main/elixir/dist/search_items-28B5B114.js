Elixir also has special forms that are always imported and cannot be skipped. These are described in Kernel.SpecialForms . The standard library Kernel provides the basic capabilities the Elixir standard library is built on top of. It is recommended to explore the standard library for advanced functionality. Here are the main groups of modules in the standard library (this list is not a complete reference, see the documentation sidebar for all entries). Built-in types The following modules handle Elixir built-in data types: Atom - literal constants with a name ( true , false , and nil are atoms) Float - numbers with floating point precision Function - a reference to code chunk, created with the fn/1 special form Integer - whole numbers (not fractions) List - collections of a variable number of elements (linked lists) Map - collections of key-value pairs Process - light-weight threads of execution Port - mechanisms to interact with the external world Tuple - collections of a fixed number of elements There are two data types without an accompanying module: Bitstring - a sequence of bits, created with Kernel.SpecialForms.&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;/1 . When the number of bits is divisible by 8, they are called binaries and can be manipulated with Erlang's :binary module Reference - a unique value in the runtime system, created with make_ref/0 Data types Elixir also provides other data types that are built on top of the types listed above. Some of them are: Date - year-month-day structs in a given calendar DateTime - date and time with time zone in a given calendar Exception - data raised from errors and unexpected scenarios MapSet - unordered collections of unique elements NaiveDateTime - date and time without time zone in a given calendar Keyword - lists of two-element tuples, often representing optional values Range - inclusive ranges between two integers Regex - regular expressions String - UTF-8 encoded binaries representing characters Time - hour:minute:second structs in a given calendar URI - representation of URIs that identify resources Version - representation of versions and requirements System modules Modules that interface with the underlying system, such as: IO - handles input and output File - interacts with the underlying file system Path - manipulates file system paths System - reads and writes system information Protocols Protocols add polymorphic dispatch to Elixir. They are contracts implementable by data types. See Protocol for more information on protocols. Elixir provides the following protocols in the standard library: Collectable - collects data into a data type Enumerable - handles collections in Elixir. The Enum module provides eager functions for working with collections, the Stream module provides lazy functions Inspect - converts data types into their programming language representation List.Chars - converts data types to their outside world representation as charlists (non-programming based) String.Chars - converts data types to their outside world representation as strings (non-programming based) Process-based and application-centric functionality The following modules build on top of processes to provide concurrency, fault-tolerance, and more. Agent - a process that encapsulates mutable state Application - functions for starting, stopping and configuring applications GenServer - a generic client-server API Registry - a key-value process-based storage Supervisor - a process that is responsible for starting, supervising and shutting down other processes Task - a process that performs computations Task.Supervisor - a supervisor for managing tasks exclusively Supporting documents Elixir documentation also includes supporting documents under the &quot;Pages&quot; section. Those are: Compatibility and deprecations - lists compatibility between every Elixir version and Erlang/OTP, release schema; lists all deprecated functions, when they were deprecated and alternatives Library guidelines - general guidelines, anti-patterns, and rules for those writing libraries Naming conventions - naming conventions for Elixir code Operators - lists all Elixir operators and their precedences Patterns and guards - an introduction to patterns, guards, and extensions Syntax reference - the language syntax reference Typespecs - types and function specifications, including list of types Unicode syntax - outlines Elixir support for Unicode Writing documentation - guidelines for writing documentation in Elixir Guards This module includes the built-in guards used by Elixir developers. They are a predefined set of functions and macros that augment pattern matching, typically invoked after the when operator. For example: def drive ( % User { age : age } ) when age &gt;= 16 do ... end The clause above will only be invoked if the user's age is more than or equal to 16. Guards also support joining multiple conditions with and and or . The whole guard is true if all guard expressions will evaluate to true . A more complete introduction to guards is available in the Patterns and guards page. Truthy and falsy values Besides the booleans true and false , Elixir has the concept of a &quot;truthy&quot; or &quot;falsy&quot; value. a value is truthy when it is neither false nor nil a value is falsy when it is either false or nil Elixir has functions, like and/2 , that only work with booleans, but also functions that work with these truthy/falsy values, like &amp;&amp;/2 and !/1 . Structural comparison The function in this module perform structural comparison. This allows different data types to be compared using comparison operators: iex&gt; 1 &lt; :an_atom true This is possible so Elixir developers can create collections, such as dictionaries and ordered sets, that store a mixture of data types in them. To understand why this matters, let's discuss the two types of comparisons we find in software: structural and semantic . Structural means we are comparing the underlying data structures and we often want those operations to be as fast as possible, because it is used to power several algorithms and data structures in the language. A semantic comparison worries about what each data type represents. For example, semantically speaking, it doesn't make sense to compare Time with Date . One example that shows the differences between structural and semantic comparisons are strings: &quot;alien&quot; sorts less than &quot;office&quot; ( &quot;alien&quot; &lt; &quot;office&quot; ) but &quot;치lien&quot; is greater than &quot;office&quot;. This happens because &lt; compares the underlying bytes that form the string. If you were doing alphabetical listing, you may want &quot;치lien&quot; to also appear before &quot;office&quot;. This means comparisons in Elixir are structural , as it has the goal of comparing data types as efficiently as possible to create flexible and perform data structures. This distinction is specially important for functions that provide ordering, such as &gt;/2 , &lt;/2 , &gt;=/2 , &lt;=/2 , min/2 , and max/2 . For example: ~D[2017-03-31] &gt; ~D[2017-04-01] will return true because structural comparison compares the :day field before :month or :year . In order to perform semantic comparisons, the relevant data-types provide a compare/2 function, such as Date.compare/2 : iex&gt; Date . compare ( ~D[2017-03-31] , ~D[2017-04-01] ) :lt Alternatively, you can use the functions in the Enum module to sort or compute a maximum/minimum: iex&gt; Enum . sort ( [ ~D[2017-03-31] , ~D[2017-04-01] ] , Date ) [ ~D[2017-03-31] , ~D[2017-04-01] ] iex&gt; Enum . max ( [ ~D[2017-03-31] , ~D[2017-04-01] ] , Date ) ~D[2017-04-01] The second argument is precisely the module to be used for semantic comparison. Keeping this distinction is important, because if semantic comparison was used by default for implementing data structures and algorithms, they could become orders of magnitude slower! Finally, note there is an overall structural sorting order, called &quot;Term Ordering&quot;, defined below. This order is provided for reference purposes, it is not required by Elixir developers to know it by heart. Term ordering number &lt; atom &lt; reference &lt; function &lt; port &lt; pid &lt; tuple &lt; map &lt; list &lt; bitstring When comparing two numbers of different types (a number being either an integer or a float), a conversion to the type with greater precision will always occur, unless the comparison operator used is either ===/2 or !== . A float will be considered more precise than an integer, unless the float is greater/less than +/-9007199254740992.0 respectively, at which point all the significant figures of the float are to the left of the decimal point. This behavior exists so that the comparison of large numbers remains transitive. The collection types are compared using the following rules: Tuples are compared by size, then element by element. Maps are compared by size, then by keys in ascending term order, then by values in key order. In the specific case of maps' key ordering, integers are always considered to be less than floats. Lists are compared element by element. Bitstrings are compared byte by byte, incomplete bytes are compared bit by bit. Atoms are compared using their string value, codepoint by codepoint. Examples We can check the truthiness of a value by using the !/1 function twice. Truthy values: iex&gt; ! ! true true iex&gt; ! ! 5 true iex&gt; ! ! [ 1 , 2 ] true iex&gt; ! ! &quot;foo&quot; true Falsy values (of which there are exactly two): iex&gt; ! ! false false iex&gt; ! ! nil false Inlining Some of the functions described in this module are inlined by the Elixir compiler into their Erlang counterparts in the :erlang module. Those functions are called BIFs (built-in internal functions) in Erlang-land and they exhibit interesting properties, as some of them are allowed in guards and others are used for compiler optimizations. Most of the inlined functions can be seen in effect when capturing the function: iex&gt; &amp; Kernel . is_atom / 1 &amp; :erlang . is_atom / 1 Those functions will be explicitly marked in their docs as &quot;inlined by the compiler&quot;.","ref":"Kernel.html","source_doc":"`Kernel` is Elixir's default environment.\n\nIt mainly consists of:\n\n  * basic language primitives, such as arithmetic operators, spawning of processes,\n    data type handling, and others\n  * macros for control-flow and defining new functionality (modules, functions, and the like)\n  * guard checks for augmenting pattern matching\n\nYou can invoke `Kernel` functions and macros anywhere in Elixir code\nwithout the use of the `Kernel.` prefix since they have all been\nautomatically imported.

Guards also support joining multiple conditions with\n`and` and `or`. The whole guard is true if all guard expressions will\nevaluate to `true`. A more complete introduction to guards is available\nin the [Patterns and guards](patterns-and-guards.md) page.\n\n## Truthy and falsy values\n\nBesides the booleans `true` and `false`, Elixir has the\nconcept of a \"truthy\" or \"falsy\" value.\n\n  *  a value is truthy when it is neither `false` nor `nil`\n  *  a value is falsy when it is either `false` or `nil`\n\nElixir has functions, like `and/2`, that *only* work with\nbooleans, but also functions that work with these\ntruthy/falsy values, like `&&/2` and `!/1`.\n\n## Structural comparison\n\nThe function in this module perform structural comparison.

For example, semantically\nspeaking, it doesn't make sense to compare `Time` with `Date`.\n\nOne example that shows the differences between structural and semantic\ncomparisons are strings: \"alien\" sorts less than \"office\" (`\"alien\" < \"office\"`)\nbut \"치lien\" is greater than \"office\". This happens because `<` compares the\nunderlying bytes that form the string. If you were doing alphabetical listing,\nyou may want \"치lien\" to also appear before \"office\".\n\nThis means **comparisons in Elixir are structural**, as it has the goal\nof comparing data types as efficiently as possible to create flexible\nand perform data structures. This distinction is specially important\nfor functions that provide ordering, such as `>/2`, `</2`, `>=/2`,\n`<=/2`, `min/2`, and `max/2`. For example:\n\n    ~D[2017-03-31] > ~D[2017-04-01]\n\nwill return `true` because structural comparison compares the `:day`\nfield before `:month` or `:year`. In order to perform semantic comparisons,\nthe relevant data-types provide a `compare/2` function, such as\n`Date.compare/2`:\n\n    iex> Date.compare(~D[2017-03-31], ~D[2017-04-01])\n    :lt\n\nAlternatively, you can use the functions in the `Enum` module to\nsort or compute a maximum/minimum:\n\n    iex> Enum.sort([~D[2017-03-31], ~D[2017-04-01]], Date)\n    [~D[2017-03-31], ~D[2017-04-01]]\n    iex> Enum.max([~D[2017-03-31], ~D[2017-04-01]], Date)\n    ~D[2017-04-01]\n\nThe second argument is precisely the module to be used for semantic\ncomparison.

For example:\n\n    defmodule MyString do\n      def join(string1, string2 \\\\ nil, separator \\\\ \" \")\n\n      def join(string1, nil, _separator) do\n        string1\n      end\n\n      def join(string1, string2, separator) do\n        string1 <> separator <> string2\n      end\n    end\n\nNote that `\\\\` can't be used with anonymous functions because they\ncan only have a sole arity.\n\n### Keyword lists with default arguments\n\nFunctions containing many arguments can benefit from using `Keyword`\nlists to group and pass attributes as a single value.\n\n    defmodule MyConfiguration do\n      @default_opts [storage: \"local\"]\n\n      def configure(resource, opts \\\\ []) do\n        opts = Keyword.merge(@default_opts, opts)\n        storage = opts[:storage]\n        # ...\n      end\n    end\n\nThe difference between using `Map` and `Keyword` to store many\narguments is `Keyword`'s keys:\n\n  * must be atoms\n  * can be given more than once\n  * ordered, as specified by the developer\n\n## Function and variable names\n\nFunction and variable names have the following syntax:\nA _lowercase ASCII letter_ or an _underscore_, followed by any number of\n_lowercase or uppercase ASCII letters_, _numbers_, or _underscores_.\nOptionally they can end in either an _exclamation mark_ or a _question mark_.\n\nFor variables, any identifier starting with an underscore should indicate an\nunused variable. For example:\n\n    def foo(bar) do\n      []\n    end\n    #=> warning: variable bar is unused\n\n    def foo(_bar) do\n      []\n    end\n    #=> no warning\n\n    def foo(_bar) do\n      _bar\n    end\n    #=> warning: the underscored variable \"_bar\" is used after being set\n\n## `rescue`/`catch`/`after`/`else`\n\nFunction bodies support `rescue`, `catch`, `after`, and `else` as `Kernel.SpecialForms.try/1`\ndoes (known as \"implicit try\"). For example, the following two functions are equivalent:\n\n    def convert(number) do\n      try do\n        String.to_integer(number)\n      rescue\n        e in ArgumentError -> {:error, e.message}\n      end\n    end\n\n    def convert(number) do\n      String.to_integer(number)\n    rescue\n      e in ArgumentError -> {:error, e.message}\n    end\n\n","title":"Kernel.def/2","type":"macro"},{"doc":"Defines a function that delegates to another module.

A common example is to @derive the Inspect protocol to hide certain fields when the struct is printed: defmodule User do @derive { Inspect , only : :name } defstruct name : nil , age : nil end For each protocol in @derive , Elixir will assert the protocol has been implemented for Any . If the Any implementation defines a __deriving__/3 callback, the callback will be invoked and it should define the implementation module. Otherwise an implementation that simply points to the Any implementation is automatically derived. For more information on the __deriving__/3 callback, see Protocol.derive/3 .

It is not enforced on updates and it does not provide any sort of value-validation. Types It is recommended to define types for structs. By convention, such a type is called t .

When referring to another struct, it's better to use User.t() instead of %User{} . The types of the struct fields that are not included in %User{} default to term() (see term/0 ).

For example, here we use Access.all/0 to traverse a list: iex&gt; users = [ %{ name : &quot;john&quot; , age : 27 } , %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; , age : 23 } ] iex&gt; get_in ( users , [ Access . all ( ) , :age ] ) [ 27 , 23 ] In case any of the components returns nil , nil will be returned and get_in/2 won't traverse any further: iex&gt; users = %{ &quot;john&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 27 } , &quot;meg&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 23 } } iex&gt; get_in ( users , [ &quot;unknown&quot; , :age ] ) nil iex&gt; # Equivalent to: iex&gt; users [ &quot;unknown&quot; ] [ :age ] nil iex&gt; users = nil iex&gt; get_in ( users , [ Access . all ( ) , :age ] ) nil Alternatively, if you need to access complex data-structures, you can use pattern matching: case users do %{ &quot;john&quot; =&gt; %{ age : age } } -&gt; age _ -&gt; default_value end Functions as keys If a key given to get_in/2 is a function, the function will be invoked passing three arguments: the operation ( :get ) the data to be accessed a function to be invoked next This means get_in/2 can be extended to provide custom lookups. That's precisely how the Access.all/0 key in the previous section behaves. For example, we can manually implement such traversal as follows: iex&gt; users = [ %{ name : &quot;john&quot; , age : 27 } , %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; , age : 23 } ] iex&gt; all = fn :get , data , next -&gt; Enum . map ( data , next ) end iex&gt; get_in ( users , [ all , :age ] ) [ 27 , 23 ] The Access module ships with many convenience accessor functions. See Access.all/0 , Access.key/2 , and others as examples. Working with structs By default, structs do not implement the Access behaviour required by this function. Therefore, you can't do this: get_in ( some_struct , [ :some_key , :nested_key ] ) The good news is that structs have predefined shape. Therefore, you can write instead: some_struct . some_key . nested_key If, by any chance, some_key can return nil, you can always fallback to pattern matching to provide nested struct handling: case some_struct do %{ some_key : %{ nested_key : value } } -&gt; value %{ } -&gt; nil end","ref":"Kernel.html#get_in/2","source_doc":"Gets a value from a nested structure.\n\nUses the `Access` module to traverse the structures\naccording to the given `keys`, unless the `key` is a\nfunction, which is detailed in a later section.\n\nNote that if none of the given keys are functions,\nthere is rarely a reason to use `get_in` over\nwriting \"regular\" Elixir code using `[]`.\n\n## Examples\n\n    iex> users = %{\"john\" => %{age: 27}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n    iex> get_in(users, [\"john\", :age])\n    27\n    iex> # Equivalent to:\n    iex> users[\"john\"][:age]\n    27\n\n`get_in/2` can also use the accessors in the `Access` module\nto traverse more complex data structures.

For example, avoid this:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      defmacro __using__(_opts) do\n        quote do\n          import MyModule\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\nIn such cases, developers should instead import or alias the module\ndirectly, so that they can customize those as they wish,\nwithout the indirection behind `use/2`.\n\nFinally, developers should also avoid defining functions inside\nthe `__using__/1` callback, unless those functions are the default\nimplementation of a previously defined `@callback` or are functions\nmeant to be overridden (see `defoverridable/1`). Even in these cases,\ndefining functions should be seen as a \"last resort\".\n","title":"Kernel.use/2","type":"macro"},{"doc":"Marks that the given variable should not be hygienized.

The second argument in a remote call\nis **always** an atom.\n\nIn the case of calls to anonymous functions, the inner tuple with the dot\nspecial form has only one argument, reflecting the fact that the operator is\nunary:\n\n    iex> quote do\n    ...>   negate.(0)\n    ...> end\n    {{:., [], [{:negate, [], __MODULE__}]}, [], [0]}\n\nWhen the right side is an alias (i.e. starts with uppercase), we get instead:\n\n    iex> quote do\n    ...>   Hello.World\n    ...> end\n    {:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:Hello, :World]}\n\nWe go into more details about aliases in the `__aliases__/1` special form\ndocumentation.\n\n## Unquoting\n\nWe can also use unquote to generate a remote call in a quoted expression:\n\n    iex> x = :downcase\n    iex> quote do\n    ...>   String.unquote(x)(\"FOO\")\n    ...> end\n    {{:., [], [{:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:String]}, :downcase]}, [], [\"FOO\"]}\n\nSimilar to `Kernel.\"FUNCTION_NAME\"`, `unquote(x)` will always generate a remote call,\nindependent of the value of `x`. To generate an alias via the quoted expression,\none needs to rely on `Module.concat/2`:\n\n    iex> x = Sample\n    iex> quote do\n    ...>   Module.concat(String, unquote(x))\n    ...> end\n    {{:., [], [{:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:Module]}, :concat]}, [],\n     [{:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:String]}, Sample]}\n\n","title":"Kernel.SpecialForms../2","type":"macro"},{"doc":"Internal special form to hold aliases information.

For floats, size * unit must result in 16, 32, or 64, corresponding to IEEE 754 binary16, binary32, and binary64, respectively. For binaries, the default is the size of the binary. Only the last binary in a match can use the default size. All others must have their size specified explicitly, even if the match is unambiguous.

Let's start with an example: iex&gt; for n &lt;- [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] , do : n * 2 [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] A comprehension accepts many generators and filters. for uses the &lt;- operator to extract values from the enumerable on its right side and match them against the pattern on the left. We call them generators: # A list generator: iex&gt; for n &lt;- [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] , do : n * 2 [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] # A comprehension with two generators iex&gt; for x &lt;- [ 1 , 2 ] , y &lt;- [ 2 , 3 ] , do : x * y [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ] Filters can also be given: # A comprehension with a generator and a filter iex&gt; for n &lt;- [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] , rem ( n , 2 ) == 0 , do : n [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] Filters must evaluate to truthy values (everything but nil and false ). If a filter is falsy, then the current value is discarded. Generators can also be used to filter as it removes any value that doesn't match the pattern on the left side of &lt;- : iex&gt; users = [ user : &quot;john&quot; , admin : &quot;meg&quot; , guest : &quot;barbara&quot; ] iex&gt; for { type , name } when type != :guest &lt;- users do ...&gt; String . upcase ( name ) ...&gt; end [ &quot;JOHN&quot; , &quot;MEG&quot; ] Bitstring generators are also supported and are very useful when you need to organize bitstring streams: iex&gt; pixels = &lt;&lt; 213 , 45 , 132 , 64 , 76 , 32 , 76 , 0 , 0 , 234 , 32 , 15 &gt;&gt; iex&gt; for &lt;&lt; r :: 8 , g :: 8 , b :: 8 &lt;- pixels &gt;&gt; , do : { r , g , b } [ { 213 , 45 , 132 } , { 64 , 76 , 32 } , { 76 , 0 , 0 } , { 234 , 32 , 15 } ] Variable assignments inside the comprehension, be it in generators, filters or inside the block, are not reflected outside of the comprehension. Variable assignments inside filters must still return a truthy value, otherwise values are discarded. Let's see an example. Imagine you have a keyword list where the key is a programming language and the value is its direct parent. Then let's try to compute the grandparent of each language. You could try this: iex&gt; languages = [ elixir : :erlang , erlang : :prolog , prolog : nil ] iex&gt; for { language , parent } &lt;- languages , grandparent = languages [ parent ] , do : { language , grandparent } [ elixir : :prolog ] Given the grandparents of Erlang and Prolog were nil, those values were filtered out. If you don't want this behaviour, a simple option is to move the filter inside the do-block: iex&gt; languages = [ elixir : :erlang , erlang : :prolog , prolog : nil ] iex&gt; for { language , parent } &lt;- languages do ...&gt; grandparent = languages [ parent ] ...&gt; { language , grandparent } ...&gt; end [ elixir : :prolog , erlang : nil , prolog : nil ] However, such option is not always available, as you may have further filters. An alternative is to convert the filter into a generator by wrapping the right side of = in a list: iex&gt; languages = [ elixir : :erlang , erlang : :prolog , prolog : nil ] iex&gt; for { language , parent } &lt;- languages , grandparent &lt;- [ languages [ parent ] ] , do : { language , grandparent } [ elixir : :prolog , erlang : nil , prolog : nil ] The :into and :uniq options In the examples above, the result returned by the comprehension was always a list. The returned result can be configured by passing an :into option, that accepts any structure as long as it implements the Collectable protocol. For example, we can use bitstring generators with the :into option to easily remove all spaces in a string: iex&gt; for &lt;&lt; c &lt;- &quot; hello world &quot; &gt;&gt; , c != ?\\s , into : &quot;&quot; , do : &lt;&lt; c &gt;&gt; &quot;helloworld&quot; The IO module provides streams, that are both Enumerable and Collectable , here is an upcase echo server using comprehensions: for line &lt;- IO . stream ( ) , into : IO . stream ( ) do String . upcase ( line ) end Similarly, uniq: true can also be given to comprehensions to guarantee the results are only added to the collection if they were not returned before. For example: iex&gt; for x &lt;- [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] , uniq : true , do : x * 2 [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] iex&gt; for &lt;&lt; x &lt;- &quot;abcabc&quot; &gt;&gt; , uniq : true , into : &quot;&quot; , do : &lt;&lt; x - 32 &gt;&gt; &quot;ABC&quot; The :reduce option While the :into option allows us to customize the comprehension behaviour to a given data type, such as putting all of the values inside a map or inside a binary, it is not always enough. For example, imagine that you have a binary with letters where you want to count how many times each lowercase letter happens, ignoring all uppercase ones. For instance, for the string &quot;AbCabCABc&quot; , we want to return the map %{&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 1} . If we were to use :into , we would need a data type that computes the frequency of each element it holds. While there is no such data type in Elixir, you could implement one yourself. A simpler option would be to use comprehensions for the mapping and filtering of letters, and then we invoke Enum.reduce/3 to build a map, for example: iex&gt; letters = for &lt;&lt; x &lt;- &quot;AbCabCABc&quot; &gt;&gt; , x in ?a .. ?z , do : &lt;&lt; x &gt;&gt; iex&gt; Enum . reduce ( letters , %{ } , fn x , acc -&gt; Map . update ( acc , x , 1 , &amp; &amp;1 + 1 ) end ) %{ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1 , &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2 , &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 1 } While the above is straight-forward, it has the downside of traversing the data at least twice. If you are expecting long strings as inputs, this can be quite expensive. Luckily, comprehensions also support the :reduce option, which would allow us to fuse both steps above into a single step: iex&gt; for &lt;&lt; x &lt;- &quot;AbCabCABc&quot; &gt;&gt; , x in ?a .. ?z , reduce : %{ } do ...&gt; acc -&gt; Map . update ( acc , &lt;&lt; x &gt;&gt; , 1 , &amp; &amp;1 + 1 ) ...&gt; end %{ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1 , &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2 , &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 1 } When the :reduce key is given, its value is used as the initial accumulator and the do block must be changed to use -&gt; clauses, where the left side of -&gt; receives the accumulated value of the previous iteration and the expression on the right side must return the new accumulator value. Once there are no more elements, the final accumulated value is returned.

Examples iex&gt; quote do ...&gt; sum ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ...&gt; end { :sum , [ ] , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] } Elixir's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Any Elixir code can be represented using Elixir data structures. The building block of Elixir macros is a tuple with three elements, for example: { :sum , [ ] , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] } The tuple above represents a function call to sum passing 1, 2 and 3 as arguments. The tuple elements are: The first element of the tuple is always an atom or another tuple in the same representation. The second element of the tuple represents metadata . The third element of the tuple are the arguments for the function call. The third argument may be an atom, which is usually a variable (or a local call). Besides the tuple described above, Elixir has a few literals that are also part of its AST. Those literals return themselves when quoted. They are: :sum #=&gt; Atoms 1 #=&gt; Integers 2.0 #=&gt; Floats [ 1 , 2 ] #=&gt; Lists &quot;strings&quot; #=&gt; Strings { key , value } #=&gt; Tuples with two elements Any other value, such as a map or a four-element tuple, must be escaped ( Macro.escape/1 ) before being introduced into an AST. Options :bind_quoted - passes a binding to the macro. Whenever a binding is given, unquote/1 is automatically disabled. :context - sets the resolution context. :generated - marks the given chunk as generated so it does not emit warnings. Currently it only works on special forms (for example, you can annotate a case but not an if ). :file - sets the quoted expressions to have the given file. :line - sets the quoted expressions to have the given line. :location - when set to :keep , keeps the current line and file from quote. Read the &quot;Stacktrace information&quot; section below for more information. :unquote - when false , disables unquoting. This means any unquote call will be kept as is in the AST, instead of replaced by the unquote arguments. For example: iex&gt; quote do ...&gt; unquote ( &quot;hello&quot; ) ...&gt; end &quot;hello&quot; iex&gt; quote unquote : false do ...&gt; unquote ( &quot;hello&quot; ) ...&gt; end { :unquote , [ ] , [ &quot;hello&quot; ] } Quote and macros quote/2 is commonly used with macros for code generation. As an exercise, let's define a macro that multiplies a number by itself (squared). In practice, there is no reason to define such a macro (and it would actually be seen as a bad practice), but it is simple enough that it allows us to focus on the important aspects of quotes and macros: defmodule Math do defmacro squared ( x ) do quote do unquote ( x ) * unquote ( x ) end end end We can invoke it as: import Math IO . puts ( &quot;Got \#{ squared ( 5 ) } &quot; ) At first, there is nothing in this example that actually reveals it is a macro. But what is happening is that, at compilation time, squared(5) becomes 5 * 5 . The argument 5 is duplicated in the produced code, we can see this behaviour in practice though because our macro actually has a bug: import Math my_number = fn -&gt; IO . puts ( &quot;Returning 5&quot; ) 5 end IO . puts ( &quot;Got \#{ squared ( my_number . ( ) ) } &quot; ) The example above will print: Returning 5 Returning 5 Got 25 Notice how &quot;Returning 5&quot; was printed twice, instead of just once. This is because a macro receives an expression and not a value (which is what we would expect in a regular function). This means that: squared ( my_number . ( ) ) Actually expands to: my_number . ( ) * my_number . ( ) Which invokes the function twice, explaining why we get the printed value twice! In the majority of the cases, this is actually unexpected behaviour, and that's why one of the first things you need to keep in mind when it comes to macros is to not unquote the same value more than once . Let's fix our macro: defmodule Math do defmacro squared ( x ) do quote do x = unquote ( x ) x * x end end end Now invoking squared(my_number.()) as before will print the value just once. In fact, this pattern is so common that most of the times you will want to use the bind_quoted option with quote/2 : defmodule Math do defmacro squared ( x ) do quote bind_quoted : [ x : x ] do x * x end end end :bind_quoted will translate to the same code as the example above. :bind_quoted can be used in many cases and is seen as good practice, not only because it helps prevent us from running into common mistakes, but also because it allows us to leverage other tools exposed by macros, such as unquote fragments discussed in some sections below. Before we finish this brief introduction, you will notice that, even though we defined a variable x inside our quote: quote do x = unquote ( x ) x * x end When we call: import Math squared ( 5 ) x ** (CompileError) undefined variable &quot;x&quot; We can see that x did not leak to the user context. This happens because Elixir macros are hygienic, a topic we will discuss at length in the next sections as well. Hygiene in variables Consider the following example: defmodule Hygiene do defmacro no_interference do quote do a = 1 end end end require Hygiene a = 10 Hygiene . no_interference ( ) a #=&gt; 10 In the example above, a returns 10 even if the macro is apparently setting it to 1 because variables defined in the macro do not affect the context the macro is executed in. If you want to set or get a variable in the caller's context, you can do it with the help of the var! macro: defmodule NoHygiene do defmacro interference do quote do var! ( a ) = 1 end end end require NoHygiene a = 10 NoHygiene . interference ( ) a #=&gt; 1 You cannot even access variables defined in the same module unless you explicitly give it a context: defmodule Hygiene do defmacro write do quote do a = 1 end end defmacro read do quote do a end end end Hygiene . write ( ) Hygiene . read ( ) ** (RuntimeError) undefined variable a or undefined function a/0 For such, you can explicitly pass the current module scope as argument: defmodule ContextHygiene do defmacro write do quote do var! ( a , ContextHygiene ) = 1 end end defmacro read do quote do var! ( a , ContextHygiene ) end end end ContextHygiene . write ( ) ContextHygiene . read ( ) #=&gt; 1 The contexts of a variable is identified by the third element of the tuple. The default context is nil and quote assigns another context to all variables within: quote ( do : var ) #=&gt; {:var, [], Elixir} In case of variables returned by macros, there may also be a :counter key in the metadata, which is used to further refine its contexts and guarantee isolation between macro invocations as seen in the previous example. Hygiene in aliases Aliases inside quote are hygienic by default. Consider the following example: defmodule Hygiene do alias Map , as : M defmacro no_interference do quote do M . new ( ) end end end require Hygiene Hygiene . no_interference ( ) #=&gt; %{} Note that, even though the alias M is not available in the context the macro is expanded, the code above works because M still expands to Map . Similarly, even if we defined an alias with the same name before invoking a macro, it won't affect the macro's result: defmodule Hygiene do alias Map , as : M defmacro no_interference do quote do M . new ( ) end end end require Hygiene alias SomethingElse , as : M Hygiene . no_interference ( ) #=&gt; %{} In some cases, you want to access an alias or a module defined in the caller. For such, you can use the alias! macro: defmodule Hygiene do # This will expand to Elixir.Nested.hello() defmacro no_interference do quote do Nested . hello ( ) end end # This will expand to Nested.hello() for # whatever is Nested in the caller defmacro interference do quote do alias! ( Nested ) . hello ( ) end end end defmodule Parent do defmodule Nested do def hello , do : &quot;world&quot; end require Hygiene Hygiene . no_interference ( ) ** (UndefinedFunctionError) ... Hygiene . interference ( ) #=&gt; &quot;world&quot; end Hygiene in imports Similar to aliases, imports in Elixir are hygienic. Consider the following code: defmodule Hygiene do defmacrop get_length do quote do length ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) end end def return_length do import Kernel , except : [ length : 1 ] get_length end end Hygiene . return_length ( ) #=&gt; 3 Notice how Hygiene.return_length/0 returns 3 even though the Kernel.length/1 function is not imported. In fact, even if return_length/0 imported a function with the same name and arity from another module, it wouldn't affect the function result: def return_length do import String , only : [ length : 1 ] get_length end Calling this new return_length/0 will still return 3 as result. Elixir is smart enough to delay the resolution to the latest possible moment. So, if you call length([1, 2, 3]) inside quote, but no length/1 function is available, it is then expanded in the caller: defmodule Lazy do defmacrop get_length do import Kernel , except : [ length : 1 ] quote do length ( &quot;hello&quot; ) end end def return_length do import Kernel , except : [ length : 1 ] import String , only : [ length : 1 ] get_length end end Lazy . return_length ( ) #=&gt; 5 Stacktrace information When defining functions via macros, developers have the option of choosing if runtime errors will be reported from the caller or from inside the quote. Let's see an example: # adder.ex defmodule Adder do @doc &quot;Defines a function that adds two numbers&quot; defmacro defadd do quote location : :keep do def add ( a , b ) , do : a + b end end end # sample.ex defmodule Sample do import Adder defadd end require Sample Sample . add ( :one , :two ) ** (ArithmeticError) bad argument in arithmetic expression adder.ex:5: Sample.add/2 When using location: :keep and invalid arguments are given to Sample.add/2 , the stacktrace information will point to the file and line inside the quote. Without location: :keep , the error is reported to where defadd was invoked. location: :keep affects only definitions inside the quote. location: :keep and unquote Do not use location: :keep if the function definition also unquote s some of the macro arguments. If you do so, Elixir will store the file definition of the current location but the unquoted arguments may contain line information of the macro caller, leading to erroneous stacktraces. Binding and unquote fragments Elixir quote/unquote mechanisms provide a functionality called unquote fragments. Unquote fragments provide an easy way to generate functions on the fly. Consider this example: kv = [ foo : 1 , bar : 2 ] Enum . each ( kv , fn { k , v } -&gt; def unquote ( k ) ( ) , do : unquote ( v ) end ) In the example above, we have generated the functions foo/0 and bar/0 dynamically. Now, imagine that we want to convert this functionality into a macro: defmacro defkv ( kv ) do Enum . map ( kv , fn { k , v } -&gt; quote do def unquote ( k ) ( ) , do : unquote ( v ) end end ) end We can invoke this macro as: defkv [ foo : 1 , bar : 2 ] However, we can't invoke it as follows: kv = [ foo : 1 , bar : 2 ] defkv kv This is because the macro is expecting its arguments to be a keyword list at compilation time. Since in the example above we are passing the representation of the variable kv , our code fails. This is actually a common pitfall when developing macros. We are assuming a particular shape in the macro. We can work around it by unquoting the variable inside the quoted expression: defmacro defkv ( kv ) do quote do Enum . each ( unquote ( kv ) , fn { k , v } -&gt; def unquote ( k ) ( ) , do : unquote ( v ) end ) end end If you try to run our new macro, you will notice it won't even compile, complaining that the variables k and v do not exist. This is because of the ambiguity: unquote(k) can either be an unquote fragment, as previously, or a regular unquote as in unquote(kv) . One solution to this problem is to disable unquoting in the macro, however, doing that would make it impossible to inject the kv representation into the tree. That's when the :bind_quoted option comes to the rescue (again!). By using :bind_quoted , we can automatically disable unquoting while still injecting the desired variables into the tree: defmacro defkv ( kv ) do quote bind_quoted : [ kv : kv ] do Enum . each ( kv , fn { k , v } -&gt; def unquote ( k ) ( ) , do : unquote ( v ) end ) end end In fact, the :bind_quoted option is recommended every time one desires to inject a value into the quote.","ref":"Kernel.SpecialForms.html#quote/2","source_doc":"Gets the representation of any expression.\n\n## Examples\n\n    iex> quote do\n    ...>   sum(1, 2, 3)\n    ...> end\n    {:sum, [], [1, 2, 3]}\n\n## Elixir's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)\n\nAny Elixir code can be represented using Elixir data structures.\nThe building block of Elixir macros is a tuple with three elements,\nfor example:\n\n    {:sum, [], [1, 2, 3]}\n\nThe tuple above represents a function call to `sum` passing 1, 2 and\n3 as arguments.

Consider the\nfollowing code:\n\n    defmodule Hygiene do\n      defmacrop get_length do\n        quote do\n          length([1, 2, 3])\n        end\n      end\n\n      def return_length do\n        import Kernel, except: [length: 1]\n        get_length\n      end\n    end\n\n    Hygiene.return_length()\n    #=> 3\n\nNotice how `Hygiene.return_length/0` returns `3` even though the `Kernel.length/1`\nfunction is not imported. In fact, even if `return_length/0`\nimported a function with the same name and arity from another\nmodule, it wouldn't affect the function result:\n\n    def return_length do\n      import String, only: [length: 1]\n      get_length\n    end\n\nCalling this new `return_length/0` will still return `3` as result.\n\nElixir is smart enough to delay the resolution to the latest\npossible moment. So, if you call `length([1, 2, 3])` inside quote,\nbut no `length/1` function is available, it is then expanded in\nthe caller:\n\n    defmodule Lazy do\n      defmacrop get_length do\n        import Kernel, except: [length: 1]\n\n        quote do\n          length(\"hello\")\n        end\n      end\n\n      def return_length do\n        import Kernel, except: [length: 1]\n        import String, only: [length: 1]\n        get_length\n      end\n    end\n\n    Lazy.return_length()\n    #=> 5\n\n## Stacktrace information\n\nWhen defining functions via macros, developers have the option of\nchoosing if runtime errors will be reported from the caller or from\ninside the quote. Let's see an example:\n\n    # adder.ex\n    defmodule Adder do\n      @doc \"Defines a function that adds two numbers\"\n      defmacro defadd do\n        quote location: :keep do\n          def add(a, b), do: a + b\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    # sample.ex\n    defmodule Sample do\n      import Adder\n      defadd\n    end\n\n    require Sample\n    Sample.add(:one, :two)\n    ** (ArithmeticError) bad argument in arithmetic expression\n        adder.ex:5: Sample.add/2\n\nWhen using `location: :keep` and invalid arguments are given to\n`Sample.add/2`, the stacktrace information will point to the file\nand line inside the quote.

Unquote fragments provide an easy way to generate\nfunctions on the fly. Consider this example:\n\n    kv = [foo: 1, bar: 2]\n    Enum.each(kv, fn {k, v} ->\n      def unquote(k)(), do: unquote(v)\n    end)\n\nIn the example above, we have generated the functions `foo/0` and\n`bar/0` dynamically. Now, imagine that we want to convert this\nfunctionality into a macro:\n\n    defmacro defkv(kv) do\n      Enum.map(kv, fn {k, v} ->\n        quote do\n          def unquote(k)(), do: unquote(v)\n        end\n      end)\n    end\n\nWe can invoke this macro as:\n\n    defkv [foo: 1, bar: 2]\n\nHowever, we can't invoke it as follows:\n\n    kv = [foo: 1, bar: 2]\n    defkv kv\n\nThis is because the macro is expecting its arguments to be a\nkeyword list at **compilation** time. Since in the example above\nwe are passing the representation of the variable `kv`, our\ncode fails.\n\nThis is actually a common pitfall when developing macros. We are\nassuming a particular shape in the macro. We can work around it\nby unquoting the variable inside the quoted expression:\n\n    defmacro defkv(kv) do\n      quote do\n        Enum.each(unquote(kv), fn {k, v} ->\n          def unquote(k)(), do: unquote(v)\n        end)\n      end\n    end\n\nIf you try to run our new macro, you will notice it won't\neven compile, complaining that the variables `k` and `v`\ndo not exist. This is because of the ambiguity: `unquote(k)`\ncan either be an unquote fragment, as previously, or a regular\nunquote as in `unquote(kv)`.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to disable unquoting in the\nmacro, however, doing that would make it impossible to inject the\n`kv` representation into the tree. That's when the `:bind_quoted`\noption comes to the rescue (again!). By using `:bind_quoted`, we\ncan automatically disable unquoting while still injecting the\ndesired variables into the tree:\n\n    defmacro defkv(kv) do\n      quote bind_quoted: [kv: kv] do\n        Enum.each(kv, fn {k, v} ->\n          def unquote(k)(), do: unquote(v)\n        end)\n      end\n    end\n\nIn fact, the `:bind_quoted` option is recommended every time\none desires to inject a value into the quote.\n","title":"Kernel.SpecialForms.quote/2","type":"macro"},{"doc":"Checks if there is a message matching the given clauses in the current process mailbox.

The else clause can be used to control flow based on the result of the expression. catch , rescue , and else clauses work based on pattern matching (similar to the case special form). Calls inside try/1 are not tail recursive since the VM needs to keep the stacktrace in case an exception happens. To retrieve the stacktrace, access __STACKTRACE__/0 inside the rescue or catch clause. rescue clauses Besides relying on pattern matching, rescue clauses provide some conveniences around exceptions that allow one to rescue an exception by its name. All the following formats are valid patterns in rescue clauses: # Rescue a single exception without binding the exception # to a variable try do UndefinedModule . undefined_function rescue UndefinedFunctionError -&gt; nil end # Rescue any of the given exception without binding try do UndefinedModule . undefined_function rescue [ UndefinedFunctionError , ArgumentError ] -&gt; nil end # Rescue and bind the exception to the variable &quot;x&quot; try do UndefinedModule . undefined_function rescue x in [ UndefinedFunctionError ] -&gt; nil end # Rescue all kinds of exceptions and bind the rescued exception # to the variable &quot;x&quot; try do UndefinedModule . undefined_function rescue x -&gt; nil end Erlang errors Erlang errors are transformed into Elixir ones when rescuing: try do :erlang . error ( :badarg ) rescue ArgumentError -&gt; :ok end #=&gt; :ok The most common Erlang errors will be transformed into their Elixir counterpart. Those which are not will be transformed into the more generic ErlangError : try do :erlang . error ( :unknown ) rescue ErlangError -&gt; :ok end #=&gt; :ok In fact, ErlangError can be used to rescue any error that is not a proper Elixir error. For example, it can be used to rescue the earlier :badarg error too, prior to transformation: try do :erlang . error ( :badarg ) rescue ErlangError -&gt; :ok end #=&gt; :ok catch clauses The catch clause can be used to catch thrown values, exits, and errors. Catching thrown values catch can be used to catch values thrown by Kernel.throw/1 : try do throw ( :some_value ) catch thrown_value -&gt; IO . puts ( &quot;A value was thrown: \#{ inspect ( thrown_value ) } &quot; ) end Catching values of any kind The catch clause also supports catching exits and errors. To do that, it allows matching on both the kind of the caught value as well as the value itself: try do exit ( :shutdown ) catch :exit , value -&gt; IO . puts ( &quot;Exited with value \#{ inspect ( value ) } &quot; ) end try do exit ( :shutdown ) catch kind , value when kind in [ :exit , :throw ] -&gt; IO . puts ( &quot;Caught exit or throw with value \#{ inspect ( value ) } &quot; ) end The catch clause also supports :error alongside :exit and :throw as in Erlang, although this is commonly avoided in favor of raise / rescue control mechanisms. One reason for this is that when catching :error , the error is not automatically transformed into an Elixir error: try do :erlang . error ( :badarg ) catch :error , :badarg -&gt; :ok end #=&gt; :ok after clauses An after clause allows you to define cleanup logic that will be invoked both when the block of code passed to try/1 succeeds and also when an error is raised. Note that the process will exit as usual when receiving an exit signal that causes it to exit abruptly and so the after clause is not guaranteed to be executed. Luckily, most resources in Elixir (such as open files, ETS tables, ports, sockets, and so on) are linked to or monitor the owning process and will automatically clean themselves up if that process exits. File . write! ( &quot;tmp/story.txt&quot; , &quot;Hello, World&quot; ) try do do_something_with ( &quot;tmp/story.txt&quot; ) after File . rm ( &quot;tmp/story.txt&quot; ) end Although after clauses are invoked whether or not there was an error, they do not modify the return value. All of the following examples return :return_me : try do :return_me after IO . puts ( &quot;I will be printed&quot; ) :not_returned end try do raise &quot;boom&quot; rescue _ -&gt; :return_me after IO . puts ( &quot;I will be printed&quot; ) :not_returned end else clauses else clauses allow the result of the body passed to try/1 to be pattern matched on: x = 2 try do 1 / x rescue ArithmeticError -&gt; :infinity else y when y &lt; 1 and y &gt; - 1 -&gt; :small _ -&gt; :large end If an else clause is not present and no exceptions are raised, the result of the expression will be returned: x = 1 ^ x = try do 1 / x rescue ArithmeticError -&gt; :infinity end However, when an else clause is present but the result of the expression does not match any of the patterns then an exception will be raised. This exception will not be caught by a catch or rescue in the same try : x = 1 try do try do 1 / x rescue # The TryClauseError cannot be rescued here: TryClauseError -&gt; :error_a else 0 -&gt; :small end rescue # The TryClauseError is rescued here: TryClauseError -&gt; :error_b end Similarly, an exception inside an else clause is not caught or rescued inside the same try : try do try do nil catch # The exit(1) call below can not be caught here: :exit , _ -&gt; :exit_a else _ -&gt; exit ( 1 ) end catch # The exit is caught here: :exit , _ -&gt; :exit_b end This means the VM no longer needs to keep the stacktrace once inside an else clause and so tail recursion is possible when using a try with a tail call as the final call inside an else clause. The same is true for rescue and catch clauses. Only the result of the tried expression falls down to the else clause. If the try ends up in the rescue or catch clauses, their result will not fall down to else : try do throw ( :catch_this ) catch :throw , :catch_this -&gt; :it_was_caught else # :it_was_caught will not fall down to this &quot;else&quot; clause. other -&gt; { :else , other } end Variable handling Since an expression inside try may not have been evaluated due to an exception, any variable created inside try cannot be accessed externally. For instance: try do x = 1 do_something_that_may_fail ( same_arg ) :ok catch _ , _ -&gt; :failed end x #=&gt; unbound variable &quot;x&quot; In the example above, x cannot be accessed since it was defined inside the try clause.

One of the ways to understand with is to show which code patterns it improves. Imagine you have a map where the fields width and height are optional and you want to compute its area, as {:ok, area} or return :error . We could implement this function as: def area ( map ) do case Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) do { :ok , width } -&gt; case Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) do { :ok , height } -&gt; { :ok , width * height } :error -&gt; :error end :error -&gt; :error end end when called as area(%{width: 10, height: 15}) , it should return {:ok, 150} . If any of the fields are missing, it returns :error . While the code above works, it is quite verbose. Using with , we could rewrite it as: def area ( map ) do with { :ok , width } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) , { :ok , height } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) do { :ok , width * height } end end Instead of defining nested case s with clauses, we use with alongside the PATTERN &lt;- EXPRESSION operator to match expressions on its right side against the pattern on the left. Consider &lt;- as a sibling to = , except that, while = raises in case of not matches, &lt;- will simply abort the with chain and return the non-matched value. Let's give it a try on IEx: iex&gt; opts = %{ width : 10 , height : 15 } iex&gt; with { :ok , width } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) , ...&gt; { :ok , height } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) do ...&gt; { :ok , width * height } ...&gt; end { :ok , 150 } If all clauses match, the do block is executed, returning its result. Otherwise the chain is aborted and the non-matched value is returned: iex&gt; opts = %{ width : 10 } iex&gt; with { :ok , width } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) , ...&gt; { :ok , height } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) do ...&gt; { :ok , width * height } ...&gt; end :error Guards can be used in patterns as well: iex&gt; users = %{ &quot;melany&quot; =&gt; &quot;guest&quot; , &quot;bob&quot; =&gt; :admin } iex&gt; with { :ok , role } when not is_binary ( role ) &lt;- Map . fetch ( users , &quot;bob&quot; ) do ...&gt; { :ok , to_string ( role ) } ...&gt; end { :ok , &quot;admin&quot; } As in for/1 , variables bound inside with/1 won't be accessible outside of with/1 . Expressions without &lt;- may also be used in clauses. For instance, you can perform regular matches with the = operator: iex&gt; width = nil iex&gt; opts = %{ width : 10 , height : 15 } iex&gt; with { :ok , width } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) , ...&gt; double_width = width * 2 , ...&gt; { :ok , height } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) do ...&gt; { :ok , double_width * height } ...&gt; end { :ok , 300 } iex&gt; width nil The behaviour of any expression in a clause is the same as if it was written outside of with . For example, = will raise a MatchError instead of returning the non-matched value: with :foo = :bar , do : :ok ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: :bar As with any other function or macro call in Elixir, explicit parens can also be used around the arguments before the do - end block: iex&gt; opts = %{ width : 10 , height : 15 } iex&gt; with ( ...&gt; { :ok , width } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) , ...&gt; { :ok , height } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) ...&gt; ) do ...&gt; { :ok , width * height } ...&gt; end { :ok , 150 } The choice between parens and no parens is a matter of preference. Else clauses An else option can be given to modify what is being returned from with in the case of a failed match: iex&gt; opts = %{ width : 10 } iex&gt; with { :ok , width } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :width ) , ...&gt; { :ok , height } &lt;- Map . fetch ( opts , :height ) do ...&gt; { :ok , width * height } ...&gt; else ...&gt; :error -&gt; ...&gt; { :error , :wrong_data } ...&gt; ...&gt; _other_error -&gt; ...&gt; :unexpected_error ...&gt; end { :error , :wrong_data } The else block works like a case clause: it can have multiple clauses, and the first match will be used. Variables bound inside with (such as width in this example) are not available in the else block. If an else block is used and there are no matching clauses, a WithClauseError exception is raised. Beware! Keep in mind that, one of potential drawback of with is that all failure clauses are flattened into a single else block. For example, take this code that checks if a given path points to an Elixir file and that it exists before creating a backup copy: with &quot;.ex&quot; &lt;- Path . extname ( path ) , true &lt;- File . exists? ( path ) do backup_path = path &lt;&gt; &quot;.backup&quot; File . cp! ( path , backup_path ) { :ok , backup_path } else binary when is_binary ( binary ) -&gt; { :error , :invalid_extension } false -&gt; { :error , :missing_file } end Note how we are having to reconstruct the result types of Path.extname/1 and File.exists?/1 to build error messages. In this case, it is better to refactor the code so each &lt;- already return the desired format in case of errors, like this: with :ok &lt;- validate_extension ( path ) , :ok &lt;- validate_exists ( path ) do backup_path = path &lt;&gt; &quot;.backup&quot; File . cp! ( path , backup_path ) { :ok , backup_path } end defp validate_extension ( path ) do if Path . extname ( path ) == &quot;.ex&quot; , do : :ok , else : { :error , :invalid_extension } end defp validate_exists ( path ) do if File . exists?

Note future datetimes are not necessarily guaranteed to exist, as time zones may change any time in the future due to geopolitical reasons. See the &quot;Datetimes as snapshots&quot; section for more information. Remember, comparisons in Elixir using ==/2 , &gt;/2 , &lt;/2 and friends are structural and based on the DateTime struct fields. For proper comparison between datetimes, use the compare/2 function. The existence of the compare/2 function in this module also allows using Enum.min/2 and Enum.max/2 functions to get the minimum and maximum datetime of an Enum . For example: iex&gt; Enum . min ( [ ~U[2022-01-12 00:01:00.00Z] , ~U[2021-01-12 00:01:00.00Z] ] , DateTime ) ~U[2021-01-12 00:01:00.00Z] Developers should avoid creating the DateTime struct directly and instead rely on the functions provided by this module as well as the ones in third-party calendar libraries. Time zone database Many functions in this module require a time zone database. By default, it uses the default time zone database returned by Calendar.get_time_zone_database/0 , which defaults to Calendar.UTCOnlyTimeZoneDatabase which only handles &quot;Etc/UTC&quot; datetimes and returns {:error, :utc_only_time_zone_database} for any other time zone. Other time zone databases can also be configured. Here are some available options and libraries: time_zone_info tz tzdata zoneinfo - recommended for embedded devices To use them, first make sure it is added as a dependency in mix.exs . It can then be configured either via configuration: config :elixir , :time_zone_database , Tz.TimeZoneDatabase or by calling Calendar.put_time_zone_database/1 : Calendar . put_time_zone_database ( Tz.TimeZoneDatabase ) See the proper names in the library installation instructions. Datetimes as snapshots In the first section, we described datetimes as a &quot;snapshot of a date and time at a given time zone&quot;. To understand precisely what we mean, let's see an example. Imagine someone in Poland wants to schedule a meeting with someone in Brazil in the next year. The meeting will happen at 2:30 AM in the Polish time zone. At what time will the meeting happen in Brazil? You can consult the time zone database today, one year before, using the API in this module and it will give you an answer that is valid right now. However, this answer may not be valid in the future. Why? Because both Brazil and Poland may change their timezone rules, ultimately affecting the result. For example, a country may choose to enter or abandon &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;, which is a process where we adjust the clock one hour forward or one hour back once per year. Whenener the rules change, the exact instant that 2:30 AM in Polish time will be in Brazil may change. In other words, whenever working with future DateTimes, there is no guarantee the results you get will always be correct, until the event actually happens. Therefore, when you ask for a future time, the answers you get are a snapshot that reflects the current state of the time zone rules. For datetimes in the past, this is not a problem, because time zone rules do not change for past events. To make matters worse, it may be that the 2:30 AM in Polish time does not actually even exist or it is ambiguous. If a certain time zone observes &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;, they will move their clock forward once a year. When this happens, there is a whole hour that does not exist. Then, when they move the clock back, there is a certain hour that will happen twice. So if you want to schedule a meeting when this shift back happens, you would need to explicitly say which of the 2:30 AM you precisely mean. Applications that are date and time sensitive, need to take these scenarios into account and correctly communicate them to users. The good news is: Elixir contains all of the building blocks necessary to tackle those problems. The default timezone database used by Elixir, Calendar.UTCOnlyTimeZoneDatabase , only works with UTC, which does not observe those issues. Once you bring a proper time zone database, the functions in this module will query the database and return the relevant information. For example, look at how DateTime.new/4 returns different results based on the scenarios described in this section.","ref":"DateTime.html","source_doc":"A datetime implementation with a time zone.\n\nThis datetime can be seen as a snapshot of a date and time\nat a given time zone.

For example, a country may\nchoose to enter or abandon \"Daylight Saving Time\", which is a\nprocess where we adjust the clock one hour forward or one hour\nback once per year. Whenener the rules change, the exact instant\nthat 2:30 AM in Polish time will be in Brazil may change.\n\nIn other words, whenever working with future DateTimes, there is\nno guarantee the results you get will always be correct, until\nthe event actually happens. Therefore, when you ask for a future\ntime, the answers you get are a snapshot that reflects the current\nstate of the time zone rules. For datetimes in the past, this is\nnot a problem, because time zone rules do not change for past\nevents.\n\nTo make matters worse, it may be that the 2:30 AM in Polish time\ndoes not actually even exist or it is ambiguous. If a certain\ntime zone observes \"Daylight Saving Time\", they will move their\nclock forward once a year. When this happens, there is a whole\nhour that does not exist. Then, when they move the clock back,\nthere is a certain hour that will happen twice. So if you want\nto schedule a meeting when this shift back happens, you would\nneed to explicitly say which of the 2:30 AM you precisely mean.\nApplications that are date and time sensitive, need to take\nthese scenarios into account and correctly communicate them to\nusers.\n\nThe good news is: Elixir contains all of the building blocks\nnecessary to tackle those problems. The default timezone database\nused by Elixir, `Calendar.UTCOnlyTimeZoneDatabase`, only works\nwith UTC, which does not observe those issues. Once you bring\na proper time zone database, the functions in this module will\nquery the database and return the relevant information. For\nexample, look at how `DateTime.new/4` returns different results\nbased on the scenarios described in this section.\n","title":"DateTime","type":"module"},{"doc":"Adds a specified amount of time to a DateTime . Accepts an amount_to_add in any unit . unit can be :day , :hour , :minute , :second or any subsecond precision from System.time_unit/0 . It defaults to :second . Negative values will move backwards in time. This function always consider the unit to be computed according to the Calendar.ISO . This function uses relies on a contiguous representation of time, ignoring the wall time and timezone changes. For example, if you add one day when there are summer time/daylight saving time changes, it will also change the time forward or backward by one hour, so the elapsed time is precisely 24 hours. Similarly, adding just a few seconds to a datetime just before &quot;spring forward&quot; can cause wall time to increase by more than an hour. While this means this function is precise in terms of elapsed time, its result may be misleading in certain use cases. For example, if a user requests a meeting to happen every day at 15:00 and you use this function to compute all future meetings by adding day after day, this function may change the meeting time to 14:00 or 16:00 if there are changes to the current timezone.

The operation is\nperformed on the binary floating point, without a conversion to decimal.\n\nThis function only accepts floats and always returns a float. Use\n`Kernel.round/1` if you want a function that accepts both floats\nand integers and always returns an integer.\n\n## Known issues\n\nThe behaviour of `round/2` for floats can be surprising. For example:\n\n    iex> Float.round(5.5675, 3)\n    5.567\n\nOne may have expected it to round to the half up 5.568. This is not a bug.\nMost decimal fractions cannot be represented as a binary floating point\nand therefore the number above is internally represented as 5.567499999,\nwhich explains the behaviour above.

It allows a developer to dynamically add, delete and register attributes, attach documentation and so forth. After a module is compiled, using many of the functions in this module will raise errors, since it is out of their scope to inspect runtime data. Most of the runtime data can be inspected via the __info__/1 function attached to each compiled module. Module attributes Each module can be decorated with one or more attributes. The following ones are currently defined by Elixir: @after_compile A hook that will be invoked right after the current module is compiled. Accepts a module or a {module, function_name} . See the &quot;Compile callbacks&quot; section below. @after_verify (since v1.14.0) A hook that will be invoked right after the current module is verified for undefined functions, deprecations, etc. Accepts a module or a {module, function_name} . See the &quot;Compile callbacks&quot; section below. @before_compile A hook that will be invoked before the module is compiled. Accepts a module or a {module, function_or_macro_name} tuple. See the &quot;Compile callbacks&quot; section below. @behaviour Note the British spelling! Behaviours can be referenced by modules to ensure they implement required specific function signatures defined by @callback . For example, you could specify a URI.Parser behaviour as follows: defmodule URI.Parser do @doc &quot;Defines a default port&quot; @callback default_port ( ) :: integer @doc &quot;Parses the given URL&quot; @callback parse ( uri_info :: URI . t ( ) ) :: URI . t ( ) end And then a module may use it as: defmodule URI.HTTP do @behaviour URI.Parser def default_port ( ) , do : 80 def parse ( info ) , do : info end If the behaviour changes or URI.HTTP does not implement one of the callbacks, a warning will be raised. For detailed documentation, see the behaviour typespec documentation . @impl (since v1.5.0) To aid in the correct implementation of behaviours, you may optionally declare @impl for implemented callbacks of a behaviour. This makes callbacks explicit and can help you to catch errors in your code. The compiler will warn in these cases: if you mark a function with @impl when that function is not a callback. if you don't mark a function with @impl when other functions are marked with @impl . If you mark one function with @impl , you must mark all other callbacks for that behaviour as @impl . @impl works on a per-context basis. If you generate a function through a macro and mark it with @impl , that won't affect the module where that function is generated in. @impl also helps with maintainability by making it clear to other developers that the function is implementing a callback. Using @impl , the example above can be rewritten as: defmodule URI.HTTP do @behaviour URI.Parser @impl true def default_port ( ) , do : 80 @impl true def parse ( info ) , do : info end You may pass either false , true , or a specific behaviour to @impl . defmodule Foo do @behaviour Bar @behaviour Baz # Will warn if neither Bar nor Baz specify a callback named bar/0. @impl true def bar ( ) , do : :ok # Will warn if Baz does not specify a callback named baz/0. @impl Baz def baz ( ) , do : :ok end The code is now more readable, as it is now clear which functions are part of your API and which ones are callback implementations. To reinforce this idea, @impl true automatically marks the function as @doc false , disabling documentation unless @doc is explicitly set. @compile Defines options for module compilation. This is used to configure both Elixir and Erlang compilers, as any other compilation pass added by external tools. For example: defmodule MyModule do @compile { :inline , my_fun : 1 } def my_fun ( arg ) do to_string ( arg ) end end Multiple uses of @compile will accumulate instead of overriding previous ones. See the &quot;Compile options&quot; section below. @deprecated (since v1.6.0) Provides the deprecation reason for a function. For example: defmodule Keyword do @deprecated &quot;Use Kernel.length/1 instead&quot; def size ( keyword ) do length ( keyword ) end end The Mix compiler automatically looks for calls to deprecated modules and emit warnings during compilation. Using the @deprecated attribute will also be reflected in the documentation of the given function and macro. You can choose between the @deprecated attribute and the documentation metadata to provide hard-deprecations (with warnings) and soft-deprecations (without warnings): This is a soft-deprecation as it simply annotates the documentation as deprecated: @doc deprecated : &quot;Use Kernel.length/1 instead&quot; def size ( keyword ) This is a hard-deprecation as it emits warnings and annotates the documentation as deprecated: @deprecated &quot;Use Kernel.length/1 instead&quot; def size ( keyword ) Currently @deprecated only supports functions and macros. However you can use the :deprecated key in the annotation metadata to annotate the docs of modules, types and callbacks too. We recommend using this feature with care, especially library authors. Deprecating code always pushes the burden towards library users. We also recommend for deprecated functionality to be maintained for long periods of time, even after deprecation, giving developers plenty of time to update (except for cases where keeping the deprecated API is undesired, such as in the presence of security issues). @doc and @typedoc Provides documentation for the entity that follows the attribute. @doc is to be used with a function, macro, callback, or macrocallback, while @typedoc with a type (public or opaque). Accepts one of these: a string (often a heredoc) false , which will make the entity invisible to documentation-extraction tools like ExDoc a keyword list, since Elixir 1.7.0 For example: defmodule MyModule do @typedoc &quot;This type&quot; @typedoc since : &quot;1.1.0&quot; @type t :: term @doc &quot;Hello world&quot; @doc since : &quot;1.1.0&quot; def hello do &quot;world&quot; end @doc &quot;&quot;&quot; Sums `a` to `b`. &quot;&quot;&quot; def sum ( a , b ) do a + b end end As can be seen in the example above, since Elixir 1.7.0 @doc and @typedoc also accept a keyword list that serves as a way to provide arbitrary metadata about the entity. Tools like ExDoc and IEx may use this information to display annotations. A common use case is the :since key, which may be used to annotate in which version the function was introduced. As illustrated in the example, it is possible to use these attributes more than once before an entity. However, the compiler will warn if used twice with binaries as that replaces the documentation text from the preceding use. Multiple uses with keyword lists will merge the lists into one. Note that since the compiler also defines some additional metadata, there are a few reserved keys that will be ignored and warned if used. Currently these are: :opaque and :defaults . Once this module is compiled, this information becomes available via the Code.fetch_docs/1 function. @dialyzer Defines warnings to request or suppress when using :dialyzer . Accepts an atom, a tuple, or a list of atoms and tuples. For example: defmodule MyModule do @dialyzer { :nowarn_function , [ my_fun : 1 ] } def my_fun ( arg ) do M . not_a_function ( arg ) end end For the list of supported warnings, see :dialyzer module . Multiple uses of @dialyzer will accumulate instead of overriding previous ones. @external_resource Specifies an external resource for the current module. Sometimes a module embeds information from an external file. This attribute allows the module to annotate which external resources have been used. Tools may use this information to ensure the module is recompiled in case any of the external resources change, see for example: mix compile.elixir . The specified file path provided is interpreted as relative to the folder containing the project's mix.exs , which is the current working directory, not the file where @external_resource is declared. If the external resource does not exist, the module still has a dependency on it, causing the module to be recompiled as soon as the file is added. @file Changes the filename used in stacktraces for the function or macro that follows the attribute, such as: defmodule MyModule do @doc &quot;Hello world&quot; @file &quot;hello.ex&quot; def hello do &quot;world&quot; end end @moduledoc Provides documentation for the current module. defmodule MyModule do @moduledoc &quot;&quot;&quot; A very useful module. &quot;&quot;&quot; @moduledoc authors : [ &quot;Alice&quot; , &quot;Bob&quot; ] end Accepts a string (often a heredoc) or false where @moduledoc false will make the module invisible to documentation extraction tools like ExDoc . Similarly to @doc also accepts a keyword list to provide metadata about the module. For more details, see the documentation of @doc above. Once this module is compiled, this information becomes available via the Code.fetch_docs/1 function. @on_definition A hook that will be invoked when each function or macro in the current module is defined. Useful when annotating functions. Accepts a module or a {module, function_name} tuple. The function must take 6 arguments: the module environment the kind of the function/macro: :def , :defp , :defmacro , or :defmacrop the function/macro name the list of quoted arguments the list of quoted guards the quoted function body If the function/macro being defined has multiple clauses, the hook will be called for each clause. Unlike other hooks, @on_definition will only invoke functions and never macros. This is to avoid @on_definition callbacks from redefining functions that have just been defined in favor of more explicit approaches. When just a module is provided, the function is assumed to be __on_definition__/6 . Example defmodule Hooks do def on_def ( _env , kind , name , args , guards , body ) do IO . puts ( &quot;Defining \#{ kind } named \#{ name } with args:&quot; ) IO . inspect ( args ) IO . puts ( &quot;and guards&quot; ) IO . inspect ( guards ) IO . puts ( &quot;and body&quot; ) IO . puts ( Macro . to_string ( body ) ) end end defmodule MyModule do @on_definition { Hooks , :on_def } def hello ( arg ) when is_binary ( arg ) or is_list ( arg ) do &quot;Hello&quot; &lt;&gt; to_string ( arg ) end def hello ( _ ) do :ok end end @on_load A hook that will be invoked whenever the module is loaded. Accepts the function name (as an atom) of a function in the current module. The function must have an arity of 0 (no arguments). If the function does not return :ok , the loading of the module will be aborted. For example: defmodule MyModule do @on_load :load_check def load_check do if some_condition ( ) do :ok else :abort end end def some_condition do false end end @vsn Specify the module version. Accepts any valid Elixir value, for example: defmodule MyModule do @vsn &quot;1.0&quot; end Struct attributes @derive - derives an implementation for the given protocol for the struct defined in the current module @enforce_keys - ensures the given keys are always set when building the struct defined in the current module See defstruct/1 for more information on building and using structs. Typespec attributes The following attributes are part of typespecs and are also built-in in Elixir: @type - defines a type to be used in @spec @typep - defines a private type to be used in @spec @opaque - defines an opaque type to be used in @spec @spec - provides a specification for a function @callback - provides a specification for a behaviour callback @macrocallback - provides a specification for a macro behaviour callback @optional_callbacks - specifies which behaviour callbacks and macro behaviour callbacks are optional @impl - declares an implementation of a callback function or macro For detailed documentation, see the typespec documentation . Custom attributes In addition to the built-in attributes outlined above, custom attributes may also be added. Custom attributes are expressed using the @/1 operator followed by a valid variable name. The value given to the custom attribute must be a valid Elixir value: defmodule MyModule do @custom_attr [ some : &quot;stuff&quot; ] end For more advanced options available when defining custom attributes, see register_attribute/3 . Compile callbacks There are three compilation callbacks, invoked in this order: @before_compile , @after_compile , and @after_verify . They are described next. @before_compile A hook that will be invoked before the module is compiled. This is often used to change how the current module is being compiled. Accepts a module or a {module, function_or_macro_name} tuple. The function/macro must take one argument: the module environment. If it's a macro, its returned value will be injected at the end of the module definition before the compilation starts. When just a module is provided, the function/macro is assumed to be __before_compile__/1 . Callbacks will run in the order they are registered. Any overridable definition will be made concrete before the first callback runs. A definition may be made overridable again in another before compile callback and it will be made concrete one last time after all callbacks run. Note : the callback function/macro must be placed in a separate module (because when the callback is invoked, the current module does not yet exist). Example defmodule A do defmacro __before_compile__ ( _env ) do quote do def hello , do : &quot;world&quot; end end end defmodule B do @before_compile A end B . hello ( ) #=&gt; &quot;world&quot; @after_compile A hook that will be invoked right after the current module is compiled. Accepts a module or a {module, function_name} tuple. The function must take two arguments: the module environment and its bytecode. When just a module is provided, the function is assumed to be __after_compile__/2 . Callbacks will run in the order they are registered. Module functions expecting not yet compiled modules (such as definitions_in/1 ) are still available at the time @after_compile is invoked. Example defmodule MyModule do @after_compile __MODULE__ def __after_compile__ ( env , _bytecode ) do IO . inspect ( env ) end end @after_verify A hook that will be invoked right after the current module is verified for undefined functions, deprecations, etc. A module is always verified after it is compiled. In Mix projects, a module is also verified when any of its runtime dependencies change. Therefore this is useful to perform verification of the current module while avoiding compile-time dependencies. Accepts a module or a {module, function_name} tuple. The function must take one argument: the module name. When just a module is provided, the function is assumed to be __after_verify__/1 . Callbacks will run in the order they are registered. Module functions expecting not yet compiled modules are no longer available at the time @after_verify is invoked. Example defmodule MyModule do @after_verify __MODULE__ def __after_verify__ ( module ) do IO . inspect ( module ) :ok end end Compile options The @compile attribute accepts different options that are used by both Elixir and Erlang compilers. Some of the common use cases are documented below: @compile :debug_info - includes :debug_info regardless of the corresponding setting in Code.get_compiler_option/1 @compile {:debug_info, false} - disables :debug_info regardless of the corresponding setting in Code.get_compiler_option/1 . Note disabling :debug_info is not recommended as it removes the ability of the Elixir compiler and other tools to static analyse the code. If you want to remove the :debug_info while deploying, tools like mix release already do such by default. @compile {:inline, some_fun: 2, other_fun: 3} - inlines the given name/arity pairs. Inlining is applied locally, calls from another module are not affected by this option @compile {:autoload, false} - disables automatic loading of modules after compilation. Instead, the module will be loaded after it is dispatched to @compile {:no_warn_undefined, Mod} or @compile {:no_warn_undefined, {Mod, fun, arity}} - does not warn if the given module or the given Mod.fun/arity are not defined","ref":"Module.html","source_doc":"Provides functions to deal with modules during compilation time.\n\nIt allows a developer to dynamically add, delete and register\nattributes, attach documentation and so forth.\n\nAfter a module is compiled, using many of the functions in\nthis module will raise errors, since it is out of their scope\nto inspect runtime data.

You can choose between\nthe `@deprecated` attribute and the documentation metadata to provide\nhard-deprecations (with warnings) and soft-deprecations (without warnings):\n\nThis is a soft-deprecation as it simply annotates the documentation\nas deprecated:\n\n    @doc deprecated: \"Use Kernel.length/1 instead\"\n    def size(keyword)\n\nThis is a hard-deprecation as it emits warnings and annotates the\ndocumentation as deprecated:\n\n    @deprecated \"Use Kernel.length/1 instead\"\n    def size(keyword)\n\nCurrently `@deprecated` only supports functions and macros. However\nyou can use the `:deprecated` key in the annotation metadata to\nannotate the docs of modules, types and callbacks too.\n\nWe recommend using this feature with care, especially library authors.\nDeprecating code always pushes the burden towards library users. We\nalso recommend for deprecated functionality to be maintained for long\nperiods of time, even after deprecation, giving developers plenty of\ntime to update (except for cases where keeping the deprecated API is\nundesired, such as in the presence of security issues).\n\n### `@doc` and `@typedoc`\n\nProvides documentation for the entity that follows the attribute.\n`@doc` is to be used with a function, macro, callback, or\nmacrocallback, while `@typedoc` with a type (public or opaque).\n\nAccepts one of these:\n\n  * a string (often a heredoc)\n  * `false`, which will make the entity invisible to documentation-extraction\n    tools like [`ExDoc`](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/)\n  * a keyword list, since Elixir 1.7.0\n\nFor example:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @typedoc \"This type\"\n      @typedoc since: \"1.1.0\"\n      @type t :: term\n\n      @doc \"Hello world\"\n      @doc since: \"1.1.0\"\n      def hello do\n        \"world\"\n      end\n\n      @doc \"\"\"\n      Sums `a` to `b`.\n      \"\"\"\n      def sum(a, b) do\n        a + b\n      end\n    end\n\nAs can be seen in the example above, since Elixir 1.7.0 `@doc` and `@typedoc`\nalso accept a keyword list that serves as a way to provide arbitrary metadata\nabout the entity. Tools like [`ExDoc`](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/) and\n`IEx` may use this information to display annotations. A common use\ncase is the `:since` key, which may be used to annotate in which version the\nfunction was introduced.\n\nAs illustrated in the example, it is possible to use these attributes\nmore than once before an entity. However, the compiler will warn if\nused twice with binaries as that replaces the documentation text from\nthe preceding use. Multiple uses with keyword lists will merge the\nlists into one.\n\nNote that since the compiler also defines some additional metadata,\nthere are a few reserved keys that will be ignored and warned if used.\nCurrently these are: `:opaque` and `:defaults`.\n\nOnce this module is compiled, this information becomes available via\nthe `Code.fetch_docs/1` function.\n\n### `@dialyzer`\n\nDefines warnings to request or suppress when using `:dialyzer`.\n\nAccepts an atom, a tuple, or a list of atoms and tuples. For example:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @dialyzer {:nowarn_function, [my_fun: 1]}\n\n      def my_fun(arg) do\n        M.not_a_function(arg)\n      end\n    end\n\nFor the list of supported warnings, see [`:dialyzer` module](`:dialyzer`).\n\nMultiple uses of `@dialyzer` will accumulate instead of overriding\nprevious ones.\n\n### `@external_resource`\n\nSpecifies an external resource for the current module.\n\nSometimes a module embeds information from an external file. This\nattribute allows the module to annotate which external resources\nhave been used.\n\nTools may use this information to ensure the module is recompiled\nin case any of the external resources change, see for example:\n[`mix compile.elixir`](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Compile.Elixir.html).\n\nThe specified file path provided is interpreted as relative to\nthe folder containing the project's `mix.exs`, which is the\ncurrent working directory, not the file where `@external_resource`\nis declared.\n\nIf the external resource does not exist, the module still has\na dependency on it, causing the module to be recompiled as soon\nas the file is added.\n\n### `@file`\n\nChanges the filename used in stacktraces for the function or macro that\nfollows the attribute, such as:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @doc \"Hello world\"\n      @file \"hello.ex\"\n      def hello do\n        \"world\"\n      end\n    end\n\n### `@moduledoc`\n\nProvides documentation for the current module.\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @moduledoc \"\"\"\n      A very useful module.\n      \"\"\"\n      @moduledoc authors: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]\n    end\n\nAccepts a string (often a heredoc) or `false` where `@moduledoc false`\nwill make the module invisible to documentation extraction tools like\n[`ExDoc`](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/).\n\nSimilarly to `@doc` also accepts a keyword list to provide metadata\nabout the module. For more details, see the documentation of `@doc`\nabove.\n\nOnce this module is compiled, this information becomes available via\nthe `Code.fetch_docs/1` function.\n\n### `@on_definition`\n\nA hook that will be invoked when each function or macro in the current\nmodule is defined. Useful when annotating functions.\n\nAccepts a module or a `{module, function_name}` tuple. The function\nmust take 6 arguments:\n\n  * the module environment\n  * the kind of the function/macro: `:def`, `:defp`, `:defmacro`, or `:defmacrop`\n  * the function/macro name\n  * the list of quoted arguments\n  * the list of quoted guards\n  * the quoted function body\n\nIf the function/macro being defined has multiple clauses, the hook will\nbe called for each clause.\n\nUnlike other hooks, `@on_definition` will only invoke functions and\nnever macros. This is to avoid `@on_definition` callbacks from\nredefining functions that have just been defined in favor of more\nexplicit approaches.\n\nWhen just a module is provided, the function is assumed to be\n`__on_definition__/6`.\n\n#### Example\n\n    defmodule Hooks do\n      def on_def(_env, kind, name, args, guards, body) do\n        IO.puts(\"Defining \#{kind} named \#{name} with args:\")\n        IO.inspect(args)\n        IO.puts(\"and guards\")\n        IO.inspect(guards)\n        IO.puts(\"and body\")\n        IO.puts(Macro.to_string(body))\n      end\n    end\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @on_definition {Hooks, :on_def}\n\n      def hello(arg) when is_binary(arg) or is_list(arg) do\n        \"Hello\" <> to_string(arg)\n      end\n\n      def hello(_) do\n        :ok\n      end\n    end\n\n### `@on_load`\n\nA hook that will be invoked whenever the module is loaded.\n\nAccepts the function name (as an atom) of a function in the current module.\nThe function must have an arity of 0 (no arguments). If the function does\nnot return `:ok`, the loading of the module will be aborted.\nFor example:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @on_load :load_check\n\n      def load_check do\n        if some_condition() do\n          :ok\n        else\n          :abort\n        end\n      end\n\n      def some_condition do\n        false\n      end\n    end\n\n### `@vsn`\n\nSpecify the module version. Accepts any valid Elixir value, for example:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @vsn \"1.0\"\n    end\n\n### Struct attributes\n\n  * `@derive` - derives an implementation for the given protocol for the\n    struct defined in the current module\n\n  * `@enforce_keys` - ensures the given keys are always set when building\n    the struct defined in the current module\n\nSee `defstruct/1` for more information on building and using structs.\n\n### Typespec attributes\n\nThe following attributes are part of typespecs and are also built-in in\nElixir:\n\n  * `@type` - defines a type to be used in `@spec`\n  * `@typep` - defines a private type to be used in `@spec`\n  * `@opaque` - defines an opaque type to be used in `@spec`\n  * `@spec` - provides a specification for a function\n  * `@callback` - provides a specification for a behaviour callback\n  * `@macrocallback` - provides a specification for a macro behaviour callback\n  * `@optional_callbacks` - specifies which behaviour callbacks and macro\n    behaviour callbacks are optional\n  * `@impl` - declares an implementation of a callback function or macro\n\nFor detailed documentation, see the [typespec documentation](typespecs.md).\n\n### Custom attributes\n\nIn addition to the built-in attributes outlined above, custom attributes may\nalso be added. Custom attributes are expressed using the `@/1` operator followed\nby a valid variable name. The value given to the custom attribute must be a valid\nElixir value:\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @custom_attr [some: \"stuff\"]\n    end\n\nFor more advanced options available when defining custom attributes, see\n`register_attribute/3`.\n\n## Compile callbacks\n\nThere are three compilation callbacks, invoked in this order:\n`@before_compile`, `@after_compile`, and `@after_verify`.\nThey are described next.\n\n### `@before_compile`\n\nA hook that will be invoked before the module is compiled. This is\noften used to change how the current module is being compiled.\n\nAccepts a module or a `{module, function_or_macro_name}` tuple. The\nfunction/macro must take one argument: the module environment. If\nit's a macro, its returned value will be injected at the end of the\nmodule definition before the compilation starts.\n\nWhen just a module is provided, the function/macro is assumed to be\n`__before_compile__/1`.\n\nCallbacks will run in the order they are registered. Any overridable\ndefinition will be made concrete before the first callback runs.\nA definition may be made overridable again in another before compile\ncallback and it will be made concrete one last time after all callbacks\nrun.\n\n*Note*: the callback function/macro must be placed in a separate module\n(because when the callback is invoked, the current module does not yet exist).\n\n#### Example\n\n    defmodule A do\n      defmacro __before_compile__(_env) do\n        quote do\n          def hello, do: \"world\"\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    defmodule B do\n      @before_compile A\n    end\n\n    B.hello()\n    #=> \"world\"\n\n### `@after_compile`\n\nA hook that will be invoked right after the current module is compiled.\n\nAccepts a module or a `{module, function_name}` tuple. The function\nmust take two arguments: the module environment and its bytecode.\nWhen just a module is provided, the function is assumed to be\n`__after_compile__/2`.\n\nCallbacks will run in the order they are registered.\n\n`Module` functions expecting not yet compiled modules (such as `definitions_in/1`)\nare still available at the time `@after_compile` is invoked.\n\n#### Example\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @after_compile __MODULE__\n\n      def __after_compile__(env, _bytecode) do\n        IO.inspect(env)\n      end\n    end\n\n### `@after_verify`\n\nA hook that will be invoked right after the current module is verified for\nundefined functions, deprecations, etc. A module is always verified after\nit is compiled. In Mix projects, a module is also verified when any of its\nruntime dependencies change. Therefore this is useful to perform verification\nof the current module while avoiding compile-time dependencies.\n\nAccepts a module or a `{module, function_name}` tuple. The function\nmust take one argument: the module name. When just a module is provided,\nthe function is assumed to be `__after_verify__/1`.\n\nCallbacks will run in the order they are registered.\n\n`Module` functions expecting not yet compiled modules are no longer available\nat the time `@after_verify` is invoked.\n\n#### Example\n\n    defmodule MyModule do\n      @after_verify __MODULE__\n\n      def __after_verify__(module) do\n        IO.inspect(module)\n        :ok\n      end\n    end\n\n## Compile options\n\nThe `@compile` attribute accepts different options that are used by both\nElixir and Erlang compilers. Some of the common use cases are documented\nbelow:\n\n  * `@compile :debug_info` - includes `:debug_info` regardless of the\n    corresponding setting in `Code.get_compiler_option/1`\n\n  * `@compile {:debug_info, false}` - disables `:debug_info` regardless\n    of the corresponding setting in `Code.get_compiler_option/1`. Note\n    disabling `:debug_info` is not recommended as it removes the ability\n    of the Elixir compiler and other tools to static analyse the code.\n    If you want to remove the `:debug_info` while deploying, tools like\n    `mix release` already do such by default.\n\n  * `@compile {:inline, some_fun: 2, other_fun: 3}` - inlines the given\n    name/arity pairs. Inlining is applied locally, calls from another\n    module are not affected by this option\n\n  * `@compile {:autoload, false}` - disables automatic loading of\n    modules after compilation. Instead, the module will be loaded after\n    it is dispatched to\n\n  * `@compile {:no_warn_undefined, Mod}` or\n    `@compile {:no_warn_undefined, {Mod, fun, arity}}` - does not warn if\n    the given module or the given `Mod.fun/arity` are not defined\n\n","title":"Module","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"Provides runtime information about functions, macros, and other information defined by the module.

Regex is based on PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) and built on top of Erlang's :re module. More information can be found in the :re module documentation . Regular expressions in Elixir can be created using the sigils ~r (see sigil_r/2 ) or ~R (see sigil_R/2 ): # A simple regular expression that matches foo anywhere in the string ~r/foo/ # A regular expression with case insensitive and Unicode options ~r/foo/iu Regular expressions created via sigils are pre-compiled and stored in the .beam file. Note that this may be a problem if you are precompiling Elixir, see the &quot;Precompilation&quot; section for more information. A Regex is represented internally as the Regex struct. Therefore, %Regex{} can be used whenever there is a need to match on them. Keep in mind that all of the structs fields are private. There is also not guarantee two regular expressions from the same source are equal, for example: ~r/(?&lt;foo&gt;.)(?&lt;bar&gt;.)/ == ~r/(?&lt;foo&gt;.)(?&lt;bar&gt;.)/ may return true or false depending on your machine, endianness, available optimizations and others. You can, however, retrieve the source of a compiled regular expression by accessing the source field, and then compare those directly: ~r/(?&lt;foo&gt;.)(?&lt;bar&gt;.)/ . source == ~r/(?&lt;foo&gt;.)(?&lt;bar&gt;.)/ . source Modifiers The modifiers available when creating a Regex are: :unicode (u) - enables Unicode specific patterns like \\p and causes character classes like \\w , \\W , \\s , and the like to also match on Unicode (see examples below in &quot;Character classes&quot;). It expects valid Unicode strings to be given on match :caseless (i) - adds case insensitivity :dotall (s) - causes dot to match newlines and also set newline to anycrlf; the new line setting can be overridden by setting (*CR) or (*LF) or (*CRLF) or (*ANY) according to :re documentation :multiline (m) - causes ^ and $ to mark the beginning and end of each line; use \\A and \\z to match the end or beginning of the string :extended (x) - whitespace characters are ignored except when escaped and allow # to delimit comments :firstline (f) - forces the unanchored pattern to match before or at the first newline, though the matched text may continue over the newline :ungreedy (U) - inverts the &quot;greediness&quot; of the regexp (the previous r option is deprecated in favor of U ) The options not available are: :anchored - not available, use ^ or \\A instead :dollar_endonly - not available, use \\z instead :no_auto_capture - not available, use ?: instead :newline - not available, use (*CR) or (*LF) or (*CRLF) or (*ANYCRLF) or (*ANY) at the beginning of the regexp according to the :re documentation Captures Many functions in this module handle what to capture in a regex match via the :capture option. The supported values are: :all - all captured subpatterns including the complete matching string (this is the default) :first - only the first captured subpattern, which is always the complete matching part of the string; all explicitly captured subpatterns are discarded :all_but_first - all but the first matching subpattern, i.e. all explicitly captured subpatterns, but not the complete matching part of the string :none - does not return matching subpatterns at all :all_names - captures all named subpattern matches in the Regex as a list ordered alphabetically by the names of the subpatterns list(binary) - a list of named captures to capture Character classes Regex supports several built in named character classes. These are used by enclosing the class name in [: :] inside a group. For example: iex&gt; String . match? ( &quot;123&quot; , ~r/^[[:alnum:]]+$/ ) true iex&gt; String . match? ( &quot;123 456&quot; , ~r/^[[:alnum:][:blank:]]+$/ ) true The supported class names are: alnum - Letters and digits alpha - Letters blank - Space or tab only cntrl - Control characters digit - Decimal digits (same as \\d) graph - Printing characters, excluding space lower - Lowercase letters print - Printing characters, including space punct - Printing characters, excluding letters, digits, and space space - Whitespace (the same as \\s from PCRE 8.34) upper - Uppercase letters word - &quot;Word&quot; characters (same as \\w) xdigit - Hexadecimal digits There is another character class, ascii , that erroneously matches Latin-1 characters instead of the 0-127 range specified by POSIX. This cannot be fixed without altering the behaviour of other classes, so we recommend matching the range with [\\\\0-\\x7f] instead. Note the behaviour of those classes may change according to the Unicode and other modifiers: iex&gt; String . match? ( &quot;jos칠&quot; , ~r/^[[:lower:]]+$/ ) false iex&gt; String . match? ( &quot;jos칠&quot; , ~r/^[[:lower:]]+$/u ) true iex&gt; Regex . replace ( ~r/ \\s / , &quot;Unicode \\u00A0 spaces&quot; , &quot;-&quot; ) &quot;Unicode맙paces&quot; iex&gt; Regex . replace ( ~r/ \\s /u , &quot;Unicode \\u00A0 spaces&quot; , &quot;-&quot; ) &quot;Unicode-spaces&quot; Precompilation Regular expressions built with sigil are precompiled and stored in .beam files. Precompiled regexes will be checked in runtime and may work slower between operating systems and OTP releases. This is rarely a problem, as most Elixir code shared during development is compiled on the target (such as dependencies, archives, and escripts) and, when running in production, the code must either be compiled on the target (via mix compile or similar) or released on the host (via mix releases or similar) with a matching OTP, operating system and architecture as the target.

Strings in Elixir are a sequence of Unicode characters, typically written between double quoted strings, such as &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;h칠ll&quot; . In case a string must have a double-quote in itself, the double quotes must be escaped with a backslash, for example: &quot;this is a string with \\&quot;double quotes\\&quot;&quot; . You can concatenate two strings with the &lt;&gt;/2 operator: iex&gt; &quot;hello&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;world&quot; &quot;hello world&quot; The functions in this module act according to The Unicode Standard, Version 15.0.0 . Interpolation Strings in Elixir also support interpolation. This allows you to place some value in the middle of a string by using the \#{} syntax: iex&gt; name = &quot;joe&quot; iex&gt; &quot;hello \#{ name } &quot; &quot;hello joe&quot; Any Elixir expression is valid inside the interpolation. If a string is given, the string is interpolated as is. If any other value is given, Elixir will attempt to convert it to a string using the String.Chars protocol. This allows, for example, to output an integer from the interpolation: iex&gt; &quot;2 + 2 = \#{ 2 + 2 } &quot; &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; In case the value you want to interpolate cannot be converted to a string, because it doesn't have a human textual representation, a protocol error will be raised. Escape characters Besides allowing double-quotes to be escaped with a backslash, strings also support the following escape characters: \\0 - Null byte \\a - Bell \\b - Backspace \\t - Horizontal tab \\n - Line feed (New lines) \\v - Vertical tab \\f - Form feed \\r - Carriage return \\e - Command Escape \\s - Space \\# - Returns the # character itself, skipping interpolation \\\\ - Single backslash \\xNN - A byte represented by the hexadecimal NN \\uNNNN - A Unicode code point represented by NNNN \\u{NNNNNN} - A Unicode code point represented by NNNNNN Note it is generally not advised to use \\xNN in Elixir strings, as introducing an invalid byte sequence would make the string invalid. If you have to introduce a character by its hexadecimal representation, it is best to work with Unicode code points, such as \\uNNNN . In fact, understanding Unicode code points can be essential when doing low-level manipulations of string, so let's explore them in detail next. Unicode and code points In order to facilitate meaningful communication between computers across multiple languages, a standard is required so that the ones and zeros on one machine mean the same thing when they are transmitted to another. The Unicode Standard acts as an official registry of virtually all the characters we know: this includes characters from classical and historical texts, emoji, and formatting and control characters as well. Unicode organizes all of the characters in its repertoire into code charts, and each character is given a unique numerical index. This numerical index is known as a Code Point. In Elixir you can use a ? in front of a character literal to reveal its code point: iex&gt; ?a 97 iex&gt; ?켹 322 Note that most Unicode code charts will refer to a code point by its hexadecimal (hex) representation, e.g. 97 translates to 0061 in hex, and we can represent any Unicode character in an Elixir string by using the \\u escape character followed by its code point number: iex&gt; &quot; \\u0061 &quot; === &quot;a&quot; true iex&gt; 0x0061 = 97 = ?a 97 The hex representation will also help you look up information about a code point, e.g. https://codepoints.net/U+0061 has a data sheet all about the lower case a , a.k.a. code point 97. Remember you can get the hex presentation of a number by calling Integer.to_string/2 : iex&gt; Integer . to_string ( ?a , 16 ) &quot;61&quot; UTF-8 encoded and encodings Now that we understand what the Unicode standard is and what code points are, we can finally talk about encodings. Whereas the code point is what we store, an encoding deals with how we store it: encoding is an implementation. In other words, we need a mechanism to convert the code point numbers into bytes so they can be stored in memory, written to disk, and such. Elixir uses UTF-8 to encode its strings, which means that code points are encoded as a series of 8-bit bytes. UTF-8 is a variable width character encoding that uses one to four bytes to store each code point. It is capable of encoding all valid Unicode code points. Let's see an example: iex&gt; string = &quot;h칠llo&quot; &quot;h칠llo&quot; iex&gt; String . length ( string ) 5 iex&gt; byte_size ( string ) 6 Although the string above has 5 characters, it uses 6 bytes, as two bytes are used to represent the character 칠 . Grapheme clusters This module also works with the concept of grapheme cluster (from now on referenced as graphemes). Graphemes can consist of multiple code points that may be perceived as a single character by readers. For example, &quot;칠&quot; can be represented either as a single &quot;e with acute&quot; code point, as seen above in the string &quot;h칠llo&quot; , or as the letter &quot;e&quot; followed by a &quot;combining acute accent&quot; (two code points): iex&gt; string = &quot; \\u0065 \\u0301 &quot; &quot;e패&quot; iex&gt; byte_size ( string ) 3 iex&gt; String . length ( string ) 1 iex&gt; String . codepoints ( string ) [ &quot;e&quot; , &quot;패&quot; ] iex&gt; String . graphemes ( string ) [ &quot;e패&quot; ] Although it looks visually the same as before, the example above is made of two characters, it is perceived by users as one. Graphemes can also be two characters that are interpreted as one by some languages. For example, some languages may consider &quot;ch&quot; as a single character. However, since this information depends on the locale, it is not taken into account by this module. In general, the functions in this module rely on the Unicode Standard, but do not contain any of the locale specific behaviour. More information about graphemes can be found in the Unicode Standard Annex #29 . For converting a binary to a different encoding and for Unicode normalization mechanisms, see Erlang's :unicode module. String and binary operations To act according to the Unicode Standard, many functions in this module run in linear time, as they need to traverse the whole string considering the proper Unicode code points. For example, String.length/1 will take longer as the input grows. On the other hand, Kernel.byte_size/1 always runs in constant time (i.e. regardless of the input size). This means often there are performance costs in using the functions in this module, compared to the more low-level operations that work directly with binaries: Kernel.binary_part/3 - retrieves part of the binary Kernel.bit_size/1 and Kernel.byte_size/1 - size related functions Kernel.is_bitstring/1 and Kernel.is_binary/1 - type-check function Plus a number of functions for working with binaries (bytes) in the :binary module A utf8 modifier is also available inside the binary syntax &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; . It can be used to match code points out of a binary/string: iex&gt; &lt;&lt; eacute :: utf8 &gt;&gt; = &quot;칠&quot; iex&gt; eacute 233 You can also fully convert a string into a list of integer code points, known as &quot;charlists&quot; in Elixir, by calling String.to_charlist/1 : iex&gt; String . to_charlist ( &quot;h칠llo&quot; ) [ 104 , 233 , 108 , 108 , 111 ] If you would rather see the underlying bytes of a string, instead of its codepoints, a common trick is to concatenate the null byte &lt;&lt;0&gt;&gt; to it: iex&gt; &quot;h칠llo&quot; &lt;&gt; &lt;&lt; 0 &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; 104 , 195 , 169 , 108 , 108 , 111 , 0 &gt;&gt; Alternatively, you can view a string's binary representation by passing an option to IO.inspect/2 : IO . inspect ( &quot;h칠llo&quot; , binaries : :as_binaries ) #=&gt; &lt;&lt;104, 195, 169, 108, 108, 111&gt;&gt; Self-synchronization The UTF-8 encoding is self-synchronizing. This means that if malformed data (i.e., data that is not possible according to the definition of the encoding) is encountered, only one code point needs to be rejected. This module relies on this behaviour to ignore such invalid characters. For example, length/1 will return a correct result even if an invalid code point is fed into it. In other words, this module expects invalid data to be detected elsewhere, usually when retrieving data from the external source. For example, a driver that reads strings from a database will be responsible to check the validity of the encoding. String.chunk/2 can be used for breaking a string into valid and invalid parts. Compile binary patterns Many functions in this module work with patterns. For example, String.split/3 can split a string into multiple strings given a pattern. This pattern can be a string, a list of strings or a compiled pattern: iex&gt; String . split ( &quot;foo bar&quot; , &quot; &quot; ) [ &quot;foo&quot; , &quot;bar&quot; ] iex&gt; String . split ( &quot;foo bar!&quot; , [ &quot; &quot; , &quot;!&quot; ] ) [ &quot;foo&quot; , &quot;bar&quot; , &quot;&quot; ] iex&gt; pattern = :binary . compile_pattern ( [ &quot; &quot; , &quot;!&quot; ] ) iex&gt; String . split ( &quot;foo bar!&quot; , pattern ) [ &quot;foo&quot; , &quot;bar&quot; , &quot;&quot; ] The compiled pattern is useful when the same match will be done over and over again. Note though that the compiled pattern cannot be stored in a module attribute as the pattern is generated at runtime and does not survive compile time.","ref":"String.html","source_doc":"Strings in Elixir are UTF-8 encoded binaries.\n\nStrings in Elixir are a sequence of Unicode characters,\ntypically written between double quoted strings, such\nas `\"hello\"` and `\"h칠ll쑆"`.\n\nIn case a string must have a double-quote in itself,\nthe double quotes must be escaped with a backslash,\nfor example: `\"this is a string with \\\"double quotes\\\"\"`.\n\nYou can concatenate two strings with the `<>/2` operator:\n\n    iex> \"hello\" <> \" \" <> \"world\"\n    \"hello world\"\n\nThe functions in this module act according to\n[The Unicode Standard, Version 15.0.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/).\n\n## Interpolation\n\nStrings in Elixir also support interpolation.

On the other hand, `Kernel.byte_size/1` always runs\nin constant time (i.e. regardless of the input size).\n\nThis means often there are performance costs in using the\nfunctions in this module, compared to the more low-level\noperations that work directly with binaries:\n\n  * `Kernel.binary_part/3` - retrieves part of the binary\n  * `Kernel.bit_size/1` and `Kernel.byte_size/1` - size related functions\n  * `Kernel.is_bitstring/1` and `Kernel.is_binary/1` - type-check function\n  * Plus a number of functions for working with binaries (bytes)\n    in the [`:binary` module](`:binary`)\n\nA `utf8` modifier is also available inside the binary syntax `<<>>`.\nIt can be used to match code points out of a binary/string:\n\n    iex> <<eacute::utf8>> = \"칠\"\n    iex> eacute\n    233\n\nYou can also fully convert a string into a list of integer code points,\nknown as \"charlists\" in Elixir, by calling `String.to_charlist/1`:\n\n    iex> String.to_charlist(\"h칠llo\")\n    [104, 233, 108, 108, 111]\n\nIf you would rather see the underlying bytes of a string, instead of\nits codepoints, a common trick is to concatenate the null byte `<<0>>`\nto it:\n\n    iex> \"h칠llo\" <> <<0>>\n    <<104, 195, 169, 108, 108, 111, 0>>\n\nAlternatively, you can view a string's binary representation by\npassing an option to `IO.inspect/2`:\n\n    IO.inspect(\"h칠llo\", binaries: :as_binaries)\n    #=> <<104, 195, 169, 108, 108, 111>>\n\n## Self-synchronization\n\nThe UTF-8 encoding is self-synchronizing. This means that\nif malformed data (i.e., data that is not possible according\nto the definition of the encoding) is encountered, only one\ncode point needs to be rejected.\n\nThis module relies on this behaviour to ignore such invalid\ncharacters. For example, `length/1` will return\na correct result even if an invalid code point is fed into it.\n\nIn other words, this module expects invalid data to be detected\nelsewhere, usually when retrieving data from the external source.\nFor example, a driver that reads strings from a database will be\nresponsible to check the validity of the encoding. `String.chunk/2`\ncan be used for breaking a string into valid and invalid parts.\n\n## Compile binary patterns\n\nMany functions in this module work with patterns. For example,\n`String.split/3` can split a string into multiple strings given\na pattern. This pattern can be a string, a list of strings or\na compiled pattern:\n\n    iex> String.split(\"foo bar\", \" \")\n    [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\n\n    iex> String.split(\"foo bar!\", [\" \", \"!\"])\n    [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"\"]\n\n    iex> pattern = :binary.compile_pattern([\" \", \"!\"])\n    iex> String.split(\"foo bar!\", pattern)\n    [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"\"]\n\nThe compiled pattern is useful when the same match will\nbe done over and over again. Note though that the compiled\npattern cannot be stored in a module attribute as the pattern\nis generated at runtime and does not survive compile time.\n","title":"String","type":"module"},{"doc":"Returns the grapheme at the position of the given UTF-8 string .

The Access module defines a behaviour for dynamically accessing keys of any type in a data structure via the data[key] syntax. Access supports keyword lists ( Keyword ) and maps ( Map ) out of the box. Keywords supports only atoms keys, keys for maps can be of any type. Both return nil if the key does not exist: iex&gt; keywords = [ a : 1 , b : 2 ] iex&gt; keywords [ :a ] 1 iex&gt; keywords [ :c ] nil iex&gt; map = %{ a : 1 , b : 2 } iex&gt; map [ :a ] 1 iex&gt; star_ratings = %{ 1.0 =&gt; &quot;驕&quot; , 1.5 =&gt; &quot;驕驕&quot; , 2.0 =&gt; &quot;驕驕&quot; } iex&gt; star_ratings [ 1.5 ] &quot;驕驕&quot; This syntax is very convenient as it can be nested arbitrarily: iex&gt; keywords = [ a : 1 , b : 2 ] iex&gt; keywords [ :c ] [ :unknown ] nil This works because accessing anything on a nil value, returns nil itself: iex&gt; nil [ :a ] nil The access syntax can also be used with the Kernel.put_in/2 , Kernel.update_in/2 and Kernel.get_and_update_in/2 macros to allow values to be set in nested data structures: iex&gt; users = %{ &quot;john&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 27 } , &quot;meg&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 23 } } iex&gt; put_in ( users [ &quot;john&quot; ] [ :age ] , 28 ) %{ &quot;john&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 28 } , &quot;meg&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 23 } } Maps and structs While the access syntax is allowed in maps via map[key] , if your map is made of predefined atom keys, you should prefer to access those atom keys with map.key instead of map[key] , as map.key will raise if the key is missing (which is not supposed to happen if the keys are predefined). Similarly, since structs are maps and structs have predefined keys, they only allow the struct.key syntax and they do not allow the struct[key] access syntax. Access.key/1 can also be used to construct dynamic access to structs and maps. In a nutshell, when using put_in/2 and friends: put_in ( struct_or_map . key , :value ) put_in ( keyword_or_map [ :key ] , :value ) When using put_in/3 and friends: put_in ( struct_or_map , [ Access . key! ( :key ) ] , :value ) put_in ( keyword_or_map , [ :key ] , :value ) This covers the dual nature of maps in Elixir, as they can be either for structured data or as a key-value store. See the Map module for more information. Nested data structures Both key-based access syntaxes can be used with the nested update functions and macros in Kernel , such as Kernel.get_in/2 , Kernel.put_in/3 , Kernel.update_in/3 , Kernel.pop_in/2 , and Kernel.get_and_update_in/3 . For example, to update a map inside another map: iex&gt; users = %{ &quot;john&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 27 } , &quot;meg&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 23 } } iex&gt; put_in ( users [ &quot;john&quot; ] . age , 28 ) %{ &quot;john&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 28 } , &quot;meg&quot; =&gt; %{ age : 23 } } This module provides convenience functions for traversing other structures, like tuples and lists. These functions can be used in all the Access -related functions and macros in Kernel . For instance, given a user map with the :name and :languages keys, here is how to deeply traverse the map and convert all language names to uppercase: iex&gt; languages = [ ...&gt; %{ name : &quot;elixir&quot; , type : :functional } , ...&gt; %{ name : &quot;c&quot; , type : :procedural } ...&gt; ] iex&gt; user = %{ name : &quot;john&quot; , languages : languages } iex&gt; update_in ( user , [ :languages , Access . all ( ) , :name ] , &amp; String . upcase / 1 ) %{ name : &quot;john&quot; , languages : [ %{ name : &quot;ELIXIR&quot; , type : :functional } , %{ name : &quot;C&quot; , type : :procedural } ] } See the functions key/1 , key!/1 , elem/1 , and all/0 for some of the available accessors.","ref":"Access.html","source_doc":"Key-based access to data structures.\n\nThe `Access` module defines a behaviour for dynamically accessing\nkeys of any type in a data structure via the `data[key]` syntax.\n\n`Access` supports keyword lists (`Keyword`) and maps (`Map`) out\nof the box. Keywords supports only atoms keys, keys for maps can\nbe of any type. Both return `nil` if the key does not exist:\n\n    iex> keywords = [a: 1, b: 2]\n    iex> keywords[:a]\n    1\n    iex> keywords[:c]\n    nil\n\n    iex> map = %{a: 1, b: 2}\n    iex> map[:a]\n    1\n\n    iex> star_ratings = %{1.0 => \"驕\", 1.5 => \"驕驕\", 2.0 => \"驕驕\"}\n    iex> star_ratings[1.5]\n    \"驕驕\"\n\nThis syntax is very convenient as it can be nested arbitrarily:\n\n    iex> keywords = [a: 1, b: 2]\n    iex> keywords[:c][:unknown]\n    nil\n\nThis works because accessing anything on a `nil` value, returns\n`nil` itself:\n\n    iex> nil[:a]\n    nil\n\nThe access syntax can also be used with the `Kernel.put_in/2`,\n`Kernel.update_in/2` and `Kernel.get_and_update_in/2` macros\nto allow values to be set in nested data structures:\n\n    iex> users = %{\"john\" => %{age: 27}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n    iex> put_in(users[\"john\"][:age], 28)\n    %{\"john\" => %{age: 28}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n\n## Maps and structs\n\nWhile the access syntax is allowed in maps via `map[key]`,\nif your map is made of predefined atom keys, you should prefer\nto access those atom keys with `map.key` instead of `map[key]`,\nas `map.key` will raise if the key is missing (which is not\nsupposed to happen if the keys are predefined).\n\nSimilarly, since structs are maps and structs have predefined\nkeys, they only allow the `struct.key` syntax and they do not\nallow the `struct[key]` access syntax. `Access.key/1` can also\nbe used to construct dynamic access to structs and maps.\n\nIn a nutshell, when using `put_in/2` and friends:\n\n    put_in(struct_or_map.key, :value)\n    put_in(keyword_or_map[:key], :value)\n\nWhen using `put_in/3` and friends:\n\n    put_in(struct_or_map, [Access.key!(:key)], :value)\n    put_in(keyword_or_map, [:key], :value)\n\nThis covers the dual nature of maps in Elixir, as they can be\neither for structured data or as a key-value store. See the `Map`\nmodule for more information.\n\n## Nested data structures\n\nBoth key-based access syntaxes can be used with the nested update\nfunctions and macros in `Kernel`, such as `Kernel.get_in/2`,\n`Kernel.put_in/3`, `Kernel.update_in/3`, `Kernel.pop_in/2`, and\n`Kernel.get_and_update_in/3`.\n\nFor example, to update a map inside another map:\n\n    iex> users = %{\"john\" => %{age: 27}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n    iex> put_in(users[\"john\"].age, 28)\n    %{\"john\" => %{age: 28}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n\nThis module provides convenience functions for traversing other\nstructures, like tuples and lists.

The first element of these tuples is known as the key , and it must be an atom. The second element, known as the value , can be any term. Keywords are mostly used to work with optional values. Examples For example, the following is a keyword list: [ { :exit_on_close , true } , { :active , :once } , { :packet_size , 1024 } ] Elixir provides a special and more concise syntax for keyword lists: [ exit_on_close : true , active : :once , packet_size : 1024 ] The two syntaxes return the exact same value. A key can be any atom, consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, an underscore or the @ sign. If the key should have any other characters, such as spaces, you can wrap it in quotes: iex&gt; [ &quot;exit on close&quot; : true ] [ &quot;exit on close&quot; : true ] Wrapping an atom in quotes does not make it a string. Keyword list keys are always atoms. Quotes should only be used when necessary or Elixir will issue a warning. Duplicate keys and ordering A keyword may have duplicate keys so it is not strictly a key-value data type. However, most of the functions in this module work on a key-value structure and behave similar to the functions you would find in the Map module. For example, Keyword.get/3 will get the first entry matching the given key, regardless if duplicate entries exist. Similarly, Keyword.put/3 and Keyword.delete/2 ensure all duplicate entries for a given key are removed when invoked. Note, however, that keyword list operations need to traverse the whole list in order to find keys, so these operations are slower than their map counterparts. A handful of functions exist to handle duplicate keys, for example, get_values/2 returns all values for a given key and delete_first/2 deletes just the first entry of the existing ones. Even though lists preserve the existing order, the functions in Keyword do not guarantee any ordering. For example, if you invoke Keyword.put(opts, new_key, new_value) , there is no guarantee for where new_key will be added to (the front, the end or anywhere else). Given ordering is not guaranteed, it is not recommended to pattern match on keyword lists either. For example, a function such as: def my_function ( [ some_key : value , another_key : another_value ] ) will match my_function ( [ some_key : :foo , another_key : :bar ] ) but it won't match my_function ( [ another_key : :bar , some_key : :foo ] ) Most of the functions in this module work in linear time. This means that the time it takes to perform an operation grows at the same rate as the length of the list. Call syntax When keyword lists are passed as the last argument to a function, the square brackets around the keyword list can be omitted. For example, the keyword list syntax: String . split ( &quot;1-0&quot; , &quot;-&quot; , [ trim : true , parts : 2 ] ) can be written without the enclosing brackets whenever it is the last argument of a function call: String . split ( &quot;1-0&quot; , &quot;-&quot; , trim : true , parts : 2 ) Since tuples, lists and maps are treated similarly to function arguments in Elixir syntax, this property is also available to them: iex&gt; { 1 , 2 , foo : :bar } { 1 , 2 , [ { :foo , :bar } ] } iex&gt; [ 1 , 2 , foo : :bar ] [ 1 , 2 , { :foo , :bar } ] iex&gt; %{ 1 =&gt; 2 , foo : :bar } %{ 1 =&gt; 2 , :foo =&gt; :bar }","ref":"Keyword.html","source_doc":"A keyword list is a list that consists exclusively of two-element tuples.\n\nThe first element of these tuples is known as the *key*, and it must be an atom.\nThe second element, known as the *value*, can be any term.\n\nKeywords are mostly used to work with optional values.\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example, the following is a keyword list:\n\n    [{:exit_on_close, true}, {:active, :once}, {:packet_size, 1024}]\n\nElixir provides a special and more concise syntax for keyword lists:\n\n    [exit_on_close: true, active: :once, packet_size: 1024]\n\nThe two syntaxes return the exact same value.\n\nA *key* can be any atom, consisting of Unicode letters, numbers,\nan underscore or the `@` sign. If the *key* should have any other\ncharacters, such as spaces, you can wrap it in quotes:\n\n    iex> [\"exit on close\": true]\n    [\"exit on close\": true]\n\nWrapping an atom in quotes does not make it a string. Keyword list\n*keys* are always atoms. Quotes should only be used when necessary\nor Elixir will issue a warning.\n\n## Duplicate keys and ordering\n\nA keyword may have duplicate keys so it is not strictly a key-value\ndata type. However, most of the functions in this module work on a\nkey-value structure and behave similar to the functions you would\nfind in the `Map` module. For example, `Keyword.get/3` will get the first\nentry matching the given key, regardless if duplicate entries exist.\nSimilarly, `Keyword.put/3` and `Keyword.delete/2` ensure all duplicate\nentries for a given key are removed when invoked. Note, however, that\nkeyword list operations need to traverse the whole list in order to find\nkeys, so these operations are slower than their map counterparts.\n\nA handful of functions exist to handle duplicate keys, for example,\n`get_values/2` returns all values for a given key and `delete_first/2`\ndeletes just the first entry of the existing ones.\n\nEven though lists preserve the existing order, the functions in\n`Keyword` do not guarantee any ordering. For example, if you invoke\n`Keyword.put(opts, new_key, new_value)`, there is no guarantee for\nwhere `new_key` will be added to (the front, the end or anywhere else).\n\nGiven ordering is not guaranteed, it is not recommended to pattern\nmatch on keyword lists either. For example, a function such as:\n\n    def my_function([some_key: value, another_key: another_value])\n\nwill match\n\n    my_function([some_key: :foo, another_key: :bar])\n\nbut it won't match\n\n    my_function([another_key: :bar, some_key: :foo])\n\nMost of the functions in this module work in linear time. This means\nthat the time it takes to perform an operation grows at the same\nrate as the length of the list.\n\n## Call syntax\n\nWhen keyword lists are passed as the last argument to a function,\nthe square brackets around the keyword list can be omitted. For\nexample, the keyword list syntax:\n\n    String.split(\"1-0\", \"-\", [trim: true, parts: 2])\n\ncan be written without the enclosing brackets whenever it is the last\nargument of a function call:\n\n    String.split(\"1-0\", \"-\", trim: true, parts: 2)\n\nSince tuples, lists and maps are treated similarly to function\narguments in Elixir syntax, this property is also available to them:\n\n    iex> {1, 2, foo: :bar}\n    {1, 2, [{:foo, :bar}]}\n\n    iex> [1, 2, foo: :bar]\n    [1, 2, {:foo, :bar}]\n\n    iex> %{1 => 2, foo: :bar}\n    %{1 => 2, :foo => :bar}\n\n","title":"Keyword","type":"module"},{"doc":"Deletes the entries in the keyword list under a specific key .

Due to their cons cell based representation, prepending an element to a list is always fast (constant time), while appending becomes slower as the list grows in size (linear time): iex&gt; list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] iex&gt; [ 0 | list ] # fast [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] iex&gt; list ++ [ 4 ] # slow [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] Most of the functions in this module work in linear time. This means that, that the time it takes to perform an operation grows at the same rate as the length of the list. For example length/1 and last/1 will run in linear time because they need to iterate through every element of the list, but first/1 will run in constant time because it only needs the first element. Lists also implement the Enumerable protocol, so many functions to work with lists are found in the Enum module. Additionally, the following functions and operators for lists are found in Kernel : ++/2 --/2 hd/1 tl/1 in/2 length/1 Charlists If a list is made of non-negative integers, where each integer represents a Unicode code point, the list can also be called a charlist. These integers must: be within the range 0..0x10FFFF ( 0..1_114_111 ); and be out of the range 0xD800..0xDFFF ( 55_296..57_343 ), which is reserved in Unicode for UTF-16 surrogate pairs. Elixir uses the ~c sigil to define charlists: iex&gt; ~c&quot;h칠llo&quot; [ 104 , 233 , 108 , 108 , 111 ] In particular, charlists will be printed back by default with the ~c sigil if they contain only printable ASCII characters: iex&gt; ~c&quot;abc&quot; ~c&quot;abc&quot; Even though the representation changed, the raw data does remain a list of integers, which can be handled as such: iex&gt; inspect ( ~c&quot;abc&quot; , charlists : :as_list ) &quot;[97, 98, 99]&quot; iex&gt; Enum . map ( ~c&quot;abc&quot; , fn num -&gt; 1000 + num end ) [ 1097 , 1098 , 1099 ] You can use the IEx.Helpers.i/1 helper to get a condensed rundown on charlists in IEx when you encounter them, which shows you the type, description and also the raw representation in one single summary. The rationale behind this behaviour is to better support Erlang libraries which may return text as charlists instead of Elixir strings. In Erlang, charlists are the default way of handling strings, while in Elixir it's binaries. One example of such functions is Application.loaded_applications/0 : Application . loaded_applications ( ) #=&gt; [ #=&gt; {:stdlib, ~c&quot;ERTS CXC 138 10&quot;, ~c&quot;2.6&quot;}, #=&gt; {:compiler, ~c&quot;ERTS CXC 138 10&quot;, ~c&quot;6.0.1&quot;}, #=&gt; {:elixir, ~c&quot;elixir&quot;, ~c&quot;1.0.0&quot;}, #=&gt; {:kernel, ~c&quot;ERTS CXC 138 10&quot;, ~c&quot;4.1&quot;}, #=&gt; {:logger, ~c&quot;logger&quot;, ~c&quot;1.0.0&quot;} #=&gt; ] A list can be checked if it is made of only printable ASCII characters with ascii_printable?/2 .

Maps do not impose any restriction on the key type: anything can be a key in a map. As a key-value structure, maps do not allow duplicated keys.

The map[key] syntax is used for dynamically created maps that may have any key, of any type. map.key is used with maps that hold a predetermined set of atoms keys, which are expected to always be present. Structs, defined via defstruct/1 , are one example of such &quot;static maps&quot;, where the keys can also be checked during compile time. Maps can be pattern matched on. When a map is on the left-hand side of a pattern match, it will match if the map on the right-hand side contains the keys on the left-hand side and their values match the ones on the left-hand side.

You can update using the atom keys syntax: iex&gt; map = %{ one : 1 , two : 2 } iex&gt; %{ map | one : &quot;one&quot; } %{ one : &quot;one&quot; , two : 2 } Or any other key: iex&gt; other_map = %{ &quot;three&quot; =&gt; 3 , &quot;four&quot; =&gt; 4 } iex&gt; %{ other_map | &quot;three&quot; =&gt; &quot;three&quot; } %{ &quot;four&quot; =&gt; 4 , &quot;three&quot; =&gt; &quot;three&quot; } When a key that does not exist in the map is updated a KeyError exception will be raised: %{ map | three : 3 } The functions in this module that need to find a specific key work in logarithmic time. This means that the time it takes to find keys grows as the map grows, but it's not directly proportional to the map size. In comparison to finding an element in a list, it performs better because lists have a linear time complexity. Some functions, such as keys/1 and values/1 , run in linear time because they need to get to every element in the map.

Otherwise, it is a decreasing range. Note, however, implicit decreasing ranges are deprecated. Therefore, if you need a decreasing range from 3 to 1 , prefer to write 3..1//-1 instead. ../0 can also be used as a shortcut to create the range 0..-1//1 , also known as the full-slice range: iex&gt; .. 0 .. - 1 // 1 Use cases Ranges typically have two uses in Elixir: as a collection or to represent a slice of another data structure.

Therefore, a range 10..0//1 is an empty range because there is no value v that is 10 &lt;= v and v &lt;= 0 . Similarly, a decreasing range first..last//step is a range from first to last decreasing by step where step must be a negative integer and values v must be first &gt;= v and v &gt;= last . Therefore, a range 0..10//-1 is an empty range because there is no value v that is 0 &gt;= v and v &gt;= 10 .

We say the functions in Stream are lazy and the functions in Enum are eager . Due to their laziness, streams are useful when working with large (or even infinite) collections.

The computations are only performed when you call a function from the Enum module. Like with Enum , the functions in this module work in linear time. This means that, the time it takes to perform an operation grows at the same rate as the length of the list. This is expected on operations such as Stream.map/2 . After all, if we want to traverse every element on a stream, the longer the stream, the more elements we need to traverse, and the longer it will take. Creating Streams There are many functions in Elixir's standard library that return streams, some examples are: IO.stream/2 - streams input lines, one by one URI.query_decoder/1 - decodes a query string, pair by pair This module also provides many convenience functions for creating streams, like Stream.cycle/1 , Stream.unfold/2 , Stream.resource/3 and more.

Some of those functions are low-level, allowing the user to interact with files or IO devices, like open/2 , copy/3 and others. This module also provides higher level functions that work with filenames and have their naming based on Unix variants. For example, one can copy a file via cp/3 and remove files and directories recursively via rm_rf/1 . Paths given to functions in this module can be either relative to the current working directory (as returned by File.cwd/0 ), or absolute paths. Shell conventions like ~ are not expanded automatically. To use paths like ~/Downloads , you can use Path.expand/1 or Path.expand/2 to expand your path to an absolute path. Encoding In order to write and read files, one must use the functions in the IO module. By default, a file is opened in binary mode, which requires the functions IO.binread/2 and IO.binwrite/2 to interact with the file. A developer may pass :utf8 as an option when opening the file, then the slower IO.read/2 and IO.write/2 functions must be used as they are responsible for doing the proper conversions and providing the proper data guarantees. Note that filenames when given as charlists in Elixir are always treated as UTF-8. In particular, we expect that the shell and the operating system are configured to use UTF-8 encoding. Binary filenames are considered raw and passed to the operating system as is. API Most of the functions in this module return :ok or {:ok, result} in case of success, {:error, reason} otherwise.

The latter should be used when the developer expects their software to fail in case the file cannot be read (i.e. it is literally an exception). Processes and raw files Every time a file is opened, Elixir spawns a new process. Writing to a file is equivalent to sending messages to the process that writes to the file descriptor. This means files can be passed between nodes and message passing guarantees they can write to the same file in a network. However, you may not always want to pay the price for this abstraction.

A developer may pass :utf8 as an option when opening the file and then all other functions from IO are available, since they work directly with Unicode data. modes_or_function can either be a list of modes or a function.

See the documentation for open/3 for more information on this function. The allowed modes: :binary - opens the file in binary mode, disabling special handling of Unicode sequences (default mode). :read - the file, which must exist, is opened for reading. :write - the file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not exist. If the file does exist, and if write is not combined with read, the file will be truncated. :append - the file will be opened for writing, and it will be created if it does not exist. Every write operation to a file opened with append will take place at the end of the file. :exclusive - the file, when opened for writing, is created if it does not exist. If the file exists, open will return {:error, :eexist} . :charlist - when this term is given, read operations on the file will return charlists rather than binaries. :compressed - makes it possible to read or write gzip compressed files.

Note that the file size obtained with stat/1 will most probably not match the number of bytes that can be read from a compressed file. :utf8 - this option denotes how data is actually stored in the disk file and makes the file perform automatic translation of characters to and from UTF-8. If data is sent to a file in a format that cannot be converted to the UTF-8 or if data is read by a function that returns data in a format that cannot cope with the character range of the data, an error occurs and the file will be closed. :delayed_write , :raw , :ram , :read_ahead , :sync , {:encoding, ...} , {:read_ahead, pos_integer} , {:delayed_write, non_neg_integer, non_neg_integer} - for more information about these options see :file.open/2 .

Every write operation to a file opened with append\n    will take place at the end of the file.\n\n  * `:exclusive` - the file, when opened for writing, is created if it does\n    not exist. If the file exists, open will return `{:error, :eexist}`.\n\n  * `:charlist` - when this term is given, read operations on the file will\n    return charlists rather than binaries.\n\n  * `:compressed` - makes it possible to read or write gzip compressed files.\n\n    The compressed option must be combined with either read or write, but not\n    both. Note that the file size obtained with `stat/1` will most probably\n    not match the number of bytes that can be read from a compressed file.\n\n  * `:utf8` - this option denotes how data is actually stored in the disk\n    file and makes the file perform automatic translation of characters to\n    and from UTF-8.\n\n    If data is sent to a file in a format that cannot be converted to the\n    UTF-8 or if data is read by a function that returns data in a format that\n    cannot cope with the character range of the data, an error occurs and the\n    file will be closed.\n\n  * `:delayed_write`, `:raw`, `:ram`, `:read_ahead`, `:sync`, `{:encoding, ...}`,\n    `{:read_ahead, pos_integer}`, `{:delayed_write, non_neg_integer, non_neg_integer}` -\n    for more information about these options see `:file.open/2`.\n\nThis function returns:\n\n  * `{:ok, io_device}` - the file has been opened in the requested mode.\n\n    `io_device` is actually the PID of the process which handles the file.\n    This process monitors the process that originally opened the file (the\n    owner process). If the owner process terminates, the file is closed and\n    the process itself terminates too. If any process to which the `io_device`\n    is linked terminates, the file will be closed and the process itself will\n    be terminated.\n\n    An `io_device` returned from this call can be used as an argument to the\n    `IO` module functions.\n\n  * `{:error, reason}` - the file could not be opened.\n\n## Examples\n\n    {:ok, file} = File.open(\"foo.tar.gz\", [:read, :compressed])\n    IO.read(file, :line)\n    File.close(file)\n\n","title":"File.open/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Similar to open/2 but expects a function as its last argument.

In case another type is given, functions will convert those types to string via the String.Chars protocol (as shown in typespecs). For more information on chardata, see the &quot;IO data&quot; section below. IO devices An IO device may be an atom or a PID. In case it is an atom, the atom must be the name of a registered process. In addition, Elixir provides two shortcuts: :stdio - a shortcut for :standard_io , which maps to the current Process.group_leader/0 in Erlang :stderr - a shortcut for the named process :standard_error provided in Erlang IO devices maintain their position, which means subsequent calls to any reading or writing functions will start from the place where the device was last accessed. The position of files can be changed using the :file.position/2 function. IO data IO data is a data type that can be used as a more efficient alternative to binaries in certain situations. A term of type IO data is a binary or a list containing bytes (integers within the 0..255 range) or nested IO data. The type is recursive. Let's see an example of one of the possible IO data representing the binary &quot;hello&quot; : [ ?h , &quot;el&quot; , [ &quot;l&quot; , [ ?o ] ] ] The built-in iodata/0 type is defined in terms of iolist/0 . An IO list is the same as IO data but it doesn't allow for a binary at the top level (but binaries are still allowed in the list itself). Use cases for IO data IO data exists because often you need to do many append operations on smaller chunks of binaries in order to create a bigger binary. However, in Erlang and Elixir concatenating binaries will copy the concatenated binaries into a new binary. def email ( username , domain ) do username &lt;&gt; &quot;@&quot; &lt;&gt; domain end In this function, creating the email address will copy the username and domain binaries. Now imagine you want to use the resulting email inside another binary: def welcome_message ( name , username , domain ) do &quot;Welcome \#{ name } , your email is: \#{ email ( username , domain ) } &quot; end IO . puts ( welcome_message ( &quot;Meg&quot; , &quot;meg&quot; , &quot;example.com&quot; ) ) #=&gt; &quot;Welcome Meg, your email is: meg@example.com&quot; Every time you concatenate binaries or use interpolation ( \#{} ) you are making copies of those binaries. However, in many cases you don't need the complete binary while you create it, but only at the end to print it out or send it somewhere. In such cases, you can construct the binary by creating IO data: def email ( username , domain ) do [ username , ?@ , domain ] end def welcome_message ( name , username , domain ) do [ &quot;Welcome &quot; , name , &quot;, your email is: &quot; , email ( username , domain ) ] end IO . puts ( welcome_message ( &quot;Meg&quot; , &quot;meg&quot; , &quot;example.com&quot; ) ) #=&gt; &quot;Welcome Meg, your email is: meg@example.com&quot; Building IO data is cheaper than concatenating binaries. Concatenating multiple pieces of IO data just means putting them together inside a list since IO data can be arbitrarily nested, and that's a cheap and efficient operation. Most of the IO-based APIs, such as :gen_tcp and IO , receive IO data and write it to the socket directly without converting it to binary. One drawback of IO data is that you can't do things like pattern match on the first part of a piece of IO data like you can with a binary, because you usually don't know the shape of the IO data. In those cases, you may need to convert it to a binary by calling iodata_to_binary/1 , which is reasonably efficient since it's implemented natively in C. Other functionality, like computing the length of IO data, can be computed directly on the iodata by calling iodata_length/1 . Chardata Erlang and Elixir also have the idea of chardata/0 . Chardata is very similar to IO data: the only difference is that integers in IO data represent bytes while integers in chardata represent Unicode code points. Bytes ( byte/0 ) are integers within the 0..255 range, while Unicode code points ( char/0 ) are integers within the 0..0x10FFFF range. The IO module provides the chardata_to_string/1 function for chardata as the &quot;counter-part&quot; of the iodata_to_binary/1 function for IO data. If you try to use iodata_to_binary/1 on chardata, it will result in an argument error. For example, let's try to put a code point that is not representable with one byte, like ? , inside IO data: IO . iodata_to_binary ( [ &quot;The symbol for pi is: &quot; , ? ] ) #=&gt; ** (ArgumentError) argument error If we use chardata instead, it will work as expected: iex&gt; IO . chardata_to_string ( [ &quot;The symbol for pi is: &quot; , ? ] ) &quot;The symbol for pi is: &quot;","ref":"IO.html","source_doc":"Functions handling input/output (IO).\n\nMany functions in this module expect an IO device as an argument.\nAn IO device must be a PID or an atom representing a process.\nFor convenience, Elixir provides `:stdio` and `:stderr` as\nshortcuts to Erlang's `:standard_io` and `:standard_error`.\n\nThe majority of the functions expect chardata.

This is done to better suit Elixir conventions. However, this means that switches can't contain underscores and switches that do contain underscores are always returned in the list of invalid switches. When parsing, it is common to list switches and their expected types: iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--debug&quot; ] , strict : [ debug : :boolean ] ) { [ debug : true ] , [ ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--source&quot; , &quot;lib&quot; ] , strict : [ source : :string ] ) { [ source : &quot;lib&quot; ] , [ ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( ...&gt; [ &quot;--source-path&quot; , &quot;lib&quot; , &quot;test/enum_test.exs&quot; , &quot;--verbose&quot; ] , ...&gt; strict : [ source_path : :string , verbose : :boolean ] ...&gt; ) { [ source_path : &quot;lib&quot; , verbose : true ] , [ &quot;test/enum_test.exs&quot; ] , [ ] } We will explore the valid switches and operation modes of option parser below. Options The following options are supported: :switches or :strict - see the &quot;Switch definitions&quot; section below :allow_nonexistent_atoms - see the &quot;Parsing unknown switches&quot; section below :aliases - see the &quot;Aliases&quot; section below :return_separator - see the &quot;Return separator&quot; section below Switch definitions Switches can be specified via one of two options: :strict - defines strict switches and their types. Any switch in argv that is not specified in the list is returned in the invalid options list. This is the preferred way to parse options. :switches - defines switches and their types. This function still attempts to parse switches that are not in this list. Both these options accept a keyword list where the key is an atom defining the name of the switch and value is the type of the switch (see the &quot;Types&quot; section below for more information). Note that you should only supply the :switches or the :strict option. If you supply both, an ArgumentError exception will be raised. Types Switches parsed by OptionParser may take zero or one arguments. The following switches types take no arguments: :boolean - sets the value to true when given (see also the &quot;Negation switches&quot; section below) :count - counts the number of times the switch is given The following switches take one argument: :integer - parses the value as an integer :float - parses the value as a float :string - parses the value as a string If a switch can't be parsed according to the given type, it is returned in the invalid options list. Modifiers Switches can be specified with modifiers, which change how they behave. The following modifiers are supported: :keep - keeps duplicated elements instead of overriding them; works with all types except :count . Specifying switch_name: :keep assumes the type of :switch_name will be :string . To use :keep with a type other than :string , use a list as the type for the switch. For example: [foo: [:integer, :keep]] . Negation switches In case a switch SWITCH is specified to have type :boolean , it may be passed as --no-SWITCH as well which will set the option to false : iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--no-op&quot; , &quot;path/to/file&quot; ] , switches : [ op : :boolean ] ) { [ op : false ] , [ &quot;path/to/file&quot; ] , [ ] } Parsing unknown switches When the :switches option is given, OptionParser will attempt to parse unknown switches: iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--debug&quot; ] , switches : [ key : :string ] ) { [ debug : true ] , [ ] , [ ] } Even though we haven't specified --debug in the list of switches, it is part of the returned options. This would also work: iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--debug&quot; , &quot;value&quot; ] , switches : [ key : :string ] ) { [ debug : &quot;value&quot; ] , [ ] , [ ] } Switches followed by a value will be assigned the value, as a string. Switches without an argument will be set automatically to true . Since we cannot assert the type of the switch value, it is preferred to use the :strict option that accepts only known switches and always verify their types. If you do want to parse unknown switches, remember that Elixir converts switches to atoms. Since atoms are not garbage-collected, OptionParser will only parse switches that translate to atoms used by the runtime to avoid leaking atoms. For instance, the code below will discard the --option-parser-example switch because the :option_parser_example atom is never used anywhere: OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--option-parser-example&quot; ] , switches : [ debug : :boolean ] ) # The :option_parser_example atom is not used anywhere below However, the code below would work as long as :option_parser_example atom is used at some point later (or earlier) in the same module . For example: { opts , _ , _ } = OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--option-parser-example&quot; ] , switches : [ debug : :boolean ] ) # ... then somewhere in the same module you access it ... opts [ :option_parser_example ] In other words, Elixir will only parse options that are used by the runtime, ignoring all others. If you would like to parse all switches, regardless if they exist or not, you can force creation of atoms by passing allow_nonexistent_atoms: true as option. Use this option with care. It is only useful when you are building command-line applications that receive dynamically-named arguments and must be avoided in long-running systems. Aliases A set of aliases can be specified in the :aliases option: iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;-d&quot; ] , aliases : [ d : :debug ] , strict : [ debug : :boolean ] ) { [ debug : true ] , [ ] , [ ] } Examples Here are some examples of working with different types and modifiers: iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--unlock&quot; , &quot;path/to/file&quot; ] , strict : [ unlock : :boolean ] ) { [ unlock : true ] , [ &quot;path/to/file&quot; ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( ...&gt; [ &quot;--unlock&quot; , &quot;--limit&quot; , &quot;0&quot; , &quot;path/to/file&quot; ] , ...&gt; strict : [ unlock : :boolean , limit : :integer ] ...&gt; ) { [ unlock : true , limit : 0 ] , [ &quot;path/to/file&quot; ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--limit&quot; , &quot;3&quot; ] , strict : [ limit : :integer ] ) { [ limit : 3 ] , [ ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--limit&quot; , &quot;xyz&quot; ] , strict : [ limit : :integer ] ) { [ ] , [ ] , [ { &quot;--limit&quot; , &quot;xyz&quot; } ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--verbose&quot; ] , switches : [ verbose : :count ] ) { [ verbose : 1 ] , [ ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;-v&quot; , &quot;-v&quot; ] , aliases : [ v : :verbose ] , strict : [ verbose : :count ] ) { [ verbose : 2 ] , [ ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--unknown&quot; , &quot;xyz&quot; ] , strict : [ ] ) { [ ] , [ &quot;xyz&quot; ] , [ { &quot;--unknown&quot; , nil } ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( ...&gt; [ &quot;--limit&quot; , &quot;3&quot; , &quot;--unknown&quot; , &quot;xyz&quot; ] , ...&gt; switches : [ limit : :integer ] ...&gt; ) { [ limit : 3 , unknown : &quot;xyz&quot; ] , [ ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( ...&gt; [ &quot;--unlock&quot; , &quot;path/to/file&quot; , &quot;--unlock&quot; , &quot;path/to/another/file&quot; ] , ...&gt; strict : [ unlock : :keep ] ...&gt; ) { [ unlock : &quot;path/to/file&quot; , unlock : &quot;path/to/another/file&quot; ] , [ ] , [ ] } Return separator The separator -- implies options should no longer be processed. By default, the separator is not returned as parts of the arguments, but that can be changed via the :return_separator option: iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--&quot; , &quot;lib&quot; ] , return_separator : true , strict : [ ] ) { [ ] , [ &quot;--&quot; , &quot;lib&quot; ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;--no-halt&quot; , &quot;--&quot; , &quot;lib&quot; ] , return_separator : true , switches : [ halt : :boolean ] ) { [ halt : false ] , [ &quot;--&quot; , &quot;lib&quot; ] , [ ] } iex&gt; OptionParser . parse ( [ &quot;script.exs&quot; , &quot;--no-halt&quot; , &quot;--&quot; , &quot;foo&quot; ] , return_separator : true , switches : [ halt : :boolean ] ) { [ { :halt , false } ] , [ &quot;script.exs&quot; , &quot;--&quot; , &quot;foo&quot; ] , [ ] }","ref":"OptionParser.html#parse/2","source_doc":"Parses `argv` into a keyword list.\n\nIt returns a three-element tuple with the form `{parsed, args, invalid}`, where:\n\n  * `parsed` is a keyword list of parsed switches with `{switch_name, value}`\n    tuples in it; `switch_name` is the atom representing the switch name while\n    `value` is the value for that switch parsed according to `opts` (see the\n    \"Examples\" section for more information)\n  * `args` is a list of the remaining arguments in `argv` as strings\n  * `invalid` is a list of invalid options as `{option_name, value}` where\n    `option_name` is the raw option and `value` is `nil` if the option wasn't\n    expected or the string value if the value didn't have the expected type for\n    the corresponding option\n\nElixir converts switches to underscored atoms, so `--source-path` becomes\n`:source_path`.

Ports provide a mechanism to start operating system processes external to the Erlang VM and communicate with them via message passing.

After the port was created, we sent it two commands in the form of messages using send/2 . The first command has the binary payload of &quot;hello&quot; and the second has &quot;world&quot;. After sending those two messages, we invoked the IEx helper flush() , which printed all messages received from the port, in this case we got &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot; back. Note that the messages are in binary because we passed the :binary option when opening the port in Port.open/2 . Without such option, it would have yielded a list of bytes. Once everything was done, we closed the port. Elixir provides many conveniences for working with ports and some drawbacks. We will explore those below. Message and function APIs There are two APIs for working with ports. It can be either asynchronous via message passing, as in the example above, or by calling the functions on this module. The messages supported by ports and their counterpart function APIs are listed below: {pid, {:command, binary}} - sends the given data to the port. See command/3 . {pid, :close} - closes the port. Unless the port is already closed, the port will reply with {port, :closed} message once it has flushed its buffers and effectively closed. See close/1 . {pid, {:connect, new_pid}} - sets the new_pid as the new owner of the port. Once a port is opened, the port is linked and connected to the caller process and communication to the port only happens through the connected process. This message makes new_pid the new connected processes. Unless the port is dead, the port will reply to the old owner with {port, :connected} . See connect/2 . On its turn, the port will send the connected process the following messages: {port, {:data, data}} - data sent by the port {port, :closed} - reply to the {pid, :close} message {port, :connected} - reply to the {pid, {:connect, new_pid}} message {:EXIT, port, reason} - exit signals in case the port crashes. If reason is not :normal , this message will only be received if the owner process is trapping exits Open mechanisms The port can be opened through four main mechanisms. As a short summary, prefer to using the :spawn and :spawn_executable options mentioned below. The other two options, :spawn_driver and :fd are for advanced usage within the VM. Also consider using System.cmd/3 if all you want is to execute a program and retrieve its return value. spawn The :spawn tuple receives a binary that is going to be executed as a full invocation. For example, we can use it to invoke &quot;echo hello&quot; directly: iex&gt; port = Port . open ( { :spawn , &quot;echo hello&quot; } , [ :binary ] ) iex&gt; flush ( ) { # Port &lt; 0.1444 &gt; , { :data , &quot;hello \\n &quot; } } :spawn will retrieve the program name from the argument and traverse your operating system $PATH environment variable looking for a matching program. Although the above is handy, it means it is impossible to invoke an executable that has whitespaces on its name or in any of its arguments. For those reasons, most times it is preferable to execute :spawn_executable . spawn_executable Spawn executable is a more restricted and explicit version of spawn. It expects full file paths to the executable you want to execute. If they are in your $PATH , they can be retrieved by calling System.find_executable/1 : iex&gt; path = System . find_executable ( &quot;echo&quot; ) iex&gt; port = Port . open ( { :spawn_executable , path } , [ :binary , args : [ &quot;hello world&quot; ] ] ) iex&gt; flush ( ) { # Port &lt; 0.1380 &gt; , { :data , &quot;hello world \\n &quot; } } When using :spawn_executable , the list of arguments can be passed via the :args option as done above. For the full list of options, see the documentation for the Erlang function :erlang.open_port/2 . fd The :fd name option allows developers to access in and out file descriptors used by the Erlang VM. You would use those only if you are reimplementing core part of the Runtime System, such as the :user and :shell processes. Zombie operating system processes A port can be closed via the close/1 function or by sending a {pid, :close} message. However, if the VM crashes, a long-running program started by the port will have its stdin and stdout channels closed but it won't be automatically terminated . While most Unix command line tools will exit once its communication channels are closed, not all command line applications will do so. You can easily check this by starting the port and then shutting down the VM and inspecting your operating system to see if the port process is still running. While we encourage graceful termination by detecting if stdin/stdout has been closed, we do not always have control over how third-party software terminates. In those cases, you can wrap the application in a script that checks for stdin. Here is such script that has been verified to work on bash shells: #!/usr/bin/env bash # Start the program in the background exec &quot;$@&quot; &amp; pid1 = $ ! # Silence warnings from here on exec &gt; / dev / null 2 &gt; &amp;1 # Read from stdin in the background and # kill running program when stdin closes exec 0 &lt; &amp;0 $ ( while read ; do : ; done kill - KILL $ pid1 ) &amp; pid2 = $ ! # Clean up wait $ pid1 ret = $ ? kill - KILL $ pid2 exit $ ret Note the program above hijacks stdin, so you won't be able to communicate with the underlying software via stdin (on the positive side, software that reads from stdin typically terminates when stdin closes). Now instead of: Port . open ( { :spawn_executable , &quot;/path/to/program&quot; } , args : [ &quot;a&quot; , &quot;b&quot; , &quot;c&quot; ] ) You may invoke: Port . open ( { :spawn_executable , &quot;/path/to/wrapper&quot; } , args : [ &quot;/path/to/program&quot; , &quot;a&quot; , &quot;b&quot; , &quot;c&quot; ] )","ref":"Port.html","source_doc":"Functions for interacting with the external world through ports.\n\nPorts provide a mechanism to start operating system processes external\nto the Erlang VM and communicate with them via message passing.\n\n## Example\n\n    iex> port = Port.open({:spawn, \"cat\"}, [:binary])\n    iex> send(port, {self(), {:command, \"hello\"}})\n    iex> send(port, {self(), {:command, \"world\"}})\n    iex> flush()\n    {#Port<0.1444>, {:data, \"hello\"}}\n    {#Port<0.1444>, {:data, \"world\"}}\n    iex> send(port, {self(), :close})\n    :ok\n    iex> flush()\n    {#Port<0.1464>, :closed}\n    :ok\n\nIn the example above, we have created a new port that executes the\nprogram `cat`. `cat` is a program available on Unix-like operating systems that\nreceives data from multiple inputs and concatenates them in the output.\n\nAfter the port was created, we sent it two commands in the form of\nmessages using `send/2`.

For those reasons,\nmost times it is preferable to execute `:spawn_executable`.\n\n### spawn_executable\n\nSpawn executable is a more restricted and explicit version of spawn. It expects\nfull file paths to the executable you want to execute. If they are in your `$PATH`,\nthey can be retrieved by calling `System.find_executable/1`:\n\n    iex> path = System.find_executable(\"echo\")\n    iex> port = Port.open({:spawn_executable, path}, [:binary, args: [\"hello world\"]])\n    iex> flush()\n    {#Port<0.1380>, {:data, \"hello world\\n\"}}\n\nWhen using `:spawn_executable`, the list of arguments can be passed via\nthe `:args` option as done above. For the full list of options, see the\ndocumentation for the Erlang function `:erlang.open_port/2`.\n\n### fd\n\nThe `:fd` name option allows developers to access `in` and `out` file\ndescriptors used by the Erlang VM. You would use those only if you are\nreimplementing core part of the Runtime System, such as the `:user` and\n`:shell` processes.\n\n## Zombie operating system processes\n\nA port can be closed via the `close/1` function or by sending a `{pid, :close}`\nmessage. However, if the VM crashes, a long-running program started by the port\nwill have its stdin and stdout channels closed but **it won't be automatically\nterminated**.\n\nWhile most Unix command line tools will exit once its communication channels\nare closed, not all command line applications will do so. You can easily check\nthis by starting the port and then shutting down the VM and inspecting your\noperating system to see if the port process is still running.\n\nWhile we encourage graceful termination by detecting if stdin/stdout has been\nclosed, we do not always have control over how third-party software terminates.\nIn those cases, you can wrap the application in a script that checks for stdin.\nHere is such script that has been verified to work on bash shells:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n    # Start the program in the background\n    exec \"$@\" &\n    pid1=$!\n\n    # Silence warnings from here on\n    exec >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n    # Read from stdin in the background and\n    # kill running program when stdin closes\n    exec 0<&0 $(\n      while read; do :; done\n      kill -KILL $pid1\n    ) &\n    pid2=$!\n\n    # Clean up\n    wait $pid1\n    ret=$?\n    kill -KILL $pid2\n    exit $ret\n\nNote the program above hijacks stdin, so you won't be able to communicate\nwith the underlying software via stdin (on the positive side, software that\nreads from stdin typically terminates when stdin closes).\n\nNow instead of:\n\n    Port.open(\n      {:spawn_executable, \"/path/to/program\"},\n      args: [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n    )\n\nYou may invoke:\n\n    Port.open(\n      {:spawn_executable, \"/path/to/wrapper\"},\n      args: [\"/path/to/program\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n    )\n\n","title":"Port","type":"module"},{"doc":"Closes the port .

An optional id that uniquely identifies the function can be given, otherwise a unique one is automatically generated. If a previously registered id is given, this function returns an error tuple. The id can be used to remove a registered signal by calling untrap_signal/2 . The given fun receives no arguments and it must return :ok . It returns {:ok, id} in case of success, {:error, :already_registered} in case the id has already been registered for the given signal, or {:error, :not_sup} in case trapping exists is not supported by the current OS. The first time a signal is trapped, it will override the default behaviour from the operating system. If the same signal is trapped multiple times, subsequent functions given to trap_signal will execute first . In other words, you can consider each function is prepended to the signal handler. By default, the Erlang VM register traps to the three signals: :sigstop - gracefully shuts down the VM with stop/0 :sigquit - halts the VM via halt/0 :sigusr1 - halts the VM via status code of 1 Therefore, if you add traps to the signals above, the default behaviour above will be executed after all user signals. Implementation notes All signals run from a single process. Therefore, blocking the fun will block subsequent traps. It is also not possible to add or remove traps from within a trap itself. Internally, this functionality is built on top of :os.set_signal/2 . When you register a trap, Elixir automatically sets it to :handle and it reverts it back to :default once all traps are removed (except for :sigquit , :sigterm , and :sigusr1 which are always handled).

ISO 8601 compliance The ISO 8601 specification is feature-rich, but allows applications to selectively implement most parts of it. The choices Elixir makes are catalogued below. Features The standard library supports a minimal set of possible ISO 8601 features. Specifically, the parser only supports calendar dates and does not support ordinal and week formats. By default Elixir only parses extended-formatted date/times. You can opt-in to parse basic-formatted date/times. NaiveDateTime.to_iso8601/2 and DateTime.to_iso8601/2 allow you to produce either basic or extended formatted strings, and Calendar.strftime/2 allows you to format datetimes however else you desire. Elixir does not support reduced accuracy formats (for example, a date without the day component) nor decimal precisions in the lowest component (such as 10:01:25,5 ). No functions exist to parse ISO 8601 durations or time intervals. Examples Elixir expects the extended format by default when parsing: iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;2015-01-23T23:50:07&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;20150123T235007&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } Parsing can be restricted to basic if desired: iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;20150123T235007Z&quot; , :basic ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;20150123T235007Z&quot; , :extended ) { :error , :invalid_format } Only calendar dates are supported in parsing; ordinal and week dates are not. iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015-04-15&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 4 , 15 } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015-105&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015-W16&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015-W016-3&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } Years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds must be fully specified: iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015-04-15&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 4 , 15 } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015-04&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;2015&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_time ( &quot;23:50:07.0123456&quot; ) { :ok , { 23 , 50 , 7 , { 12345 , 6 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_time ( &quot;23:50:07&quot; ) { :ok , { 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_time ( &quot;23:50&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_time ( &quot;23&quot; ) { :error , :invalid_format } Extensions The parser and formatter adopt one ISO 8601 extension: extended year notation. This allows dates to be prefixed with a + or - sign, extending the range of expressible years from the default ( 0000..9999 ) to -9999..9999 . Elixir still restricts years in this format to four digits. Examples iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;-2015-01-23&quot; ) { :ok , { - 2015 , 1 , 23 } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_date ( &quot;+2015-01-23&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;-2015-01-23 23:50:07&quot; ) { :ok , { - 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;+2015-01-23 23:50:07&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_utc_datetime ( &quot;-2015-01-23 23:50:07Z&quot; ) { :ok , { - 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } , 0 } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_utc_datetime ( &quot;+2015-01-23 23:50:07Z&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 0 , 0 } } , 0 } Additions ISO 8601 does not allow a whitespace instead of T as a separator between date and times, both when parsing and formatting. This is a common enough representation, Elixir allows it during parsing. The formatting of dates in NaiveDateTime.to_iso8601/1 and DateTime.to_iso8601/1 do produce specification-compliant string representations using the T separator. Examples iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;2015-01-23 23:50:07.0123456&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 12345 , 6 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_naive_datetime ( &quot;2015-01-23T23:50:07.0123456&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 12345 , 6 } } } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_utc_datetime ( &quot;2015-01-23 23:50:07.0123456Z&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 12345 , 6 } } , 0 } iex&gt; Calendar.ISO . parse_utc_datetime ( &quot;2015-01-23T23:50:07.0123456Z&quot; ) { :ok , { 2015 , 1 , 23 , 23 , 50 , 7 , { 12345 , 6 } } , 0 }","ref":"Calendar.ISO.html","source_doc":"The default calendar implementation, a Gregorian calendar following ISO 8601.\n\nThis calendar implements a proleptic Gregorian calendar and\nis therefore compatible with the calendar used in most countries\ntoday.

You can opt-in\nto parse basic-formatted date/times.\n\n`NaiveDateTime.to_iso8601/2` and `DateTime.to_iso8601/2` allow you to produce\neither basic or extended formatted strings, and `Calendar.strftime/2` allows\nyou to format datetimes however else you desire.\n\nElixir does not support reduced accuracy formats (for example, a date without\nthe day component) nor decimal precisions in the lowest component (such as\n`10:01:25,5`). No functions exist to parse ISO 8601 durations or time intervals.\n\n#### Examples\n\nElixir expects the extended format by default when parsing:\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"2015-01-23T23:50:07\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"20150123T235007\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n\nParsing can be restricted to basic if desired:\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"20150123T235007Z\", :basic)\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"20150123T235007Z\", :extended)\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n\nOnly calendar dates are supported in parsing; ordinal and week dates are not.\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015-04-15\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 4, 15}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015-105\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015-W16\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015-W016-3\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n\nYears, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds must be fully specified:\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015-04-15\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 4, 15}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015-04\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"2015\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_time(\"23:50:07.0123456\")\n    {:ok, {23, 50, 7, {12345, 6}}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_time(\"23:50:07\")\n    {:ok, {23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_time(\"23:50\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_time(\"23\")\n    {:error, :invalid_format}\n\n### Extensions\n\nThe parser and formatter adopt one ISO 8601 extension: extended year notation.\n\nThis allows dates to be prefixed with a `+` or `-` sign, extending the range of\nexpressible years from the default (`0000..9999`) to `-9999..9999`. Elixir still\nrestricts years in this format to four digits.\n\n#### Examples\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"-2015-01-23\")\n    {:ok, {-2015, 1, 23}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_date(\"+2015-01-23\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23}}\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"-2015-01-23 23:50:07\")\n    {:ok, {-2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"+2015-01-23 23:50:07\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}}\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_utc_datetime(\"-2015-01-23 23:50:07Z\")\n    {:ok, {-2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}, 0}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_utc_datetime(\"+2015-01-23 23:50:07Z\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {0, 0}}, 0}\n\n### Additions\n\nISO 8601 does not allow a whitespace instead of `T` as a separator\nbetween date and times, both when parsing and formatting.\nThis is a common enough representation, Elixir allows it during parsing.\n\nThe formatting of dates in `NaiveDateTime.to_iso8601/1` and `DateTime.to_iso8601/1`\ndo produce specification-compliant string representations using the `T` separator.\n\n#### Examples\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"2015-01-23 23:50:07.0123456\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {12345, 6}}}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_naive_datetime(\"2015-01-23T23:50:07.0123456\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {12345, 6}}}\n\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_utc_datetime(\"2015-01-23 23:50:07.0123456Z\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {12345, 6}}, 0}\n    iex> Calendar.ISO.parse_utc_datetime(\"2015-01-23T23:50:07.0123456Z\")\n    {:ok, {2015, 1, 23, 23, 50, 7, {12345, 6}}, 0}\n\n","title":"Calendar.ISO","type":"module"},{"doc":"Converts the given date into a string.

Often in Elixir there is a need to share or store state that must be accessed from different processes or by the same process at different points in time. The Agent module provides a basic server implementation that allows state to be retrieved and updated via a simple API. Examples For example, the following agent implements a counter: defmodule Counter do use Agent def start_link ( initial_value ) do Agent . start_link ( fn -&gt; initial_value end , name : __MODULE__ ) end def value do Agent . get ( __MODULE__ , &amp; &amp;1 ) end def increment do Agent . update ( __MODULE__ , &amp; ( &amp;1 + 1 ) ) end end Usage would be: Counter . start_link ( 0 ) #=&gt; {:ok, #PID&lt;0.123.0&gt;} Counter . value ( ) #=&gt; 0 Counter . increment ( ) #=&gt; :ok Counter . increment ( ) #=&gt; :ok Counter . value ( ) #=&gt; 2 Thanks to the agent server process, the counter can be safely incremented concurrently. Agents provide a segregation between the client and server APIs (similar to GenServer s). In particular, the functions passed as arguments to the calls to Agent functions are invoked inside the agent (the server). This distinction is important because you may want to avoid expensive operations inside the agent, as they will effectively block the agent until the request is fulfilled. Consider these two examples: # Compute in the agent/server def get_something ( agent ) do Agent . get ( agent , fn state -&gt; do_something_expensive ( state ) end ) end # Compute in the agent/client def get_something ( agent ) do Agent . get ( agent , &amp; &amp;1 ) |&gt; do_something_expensive ( ) end The first function blocks the agent. The second function copies all the state to the client and then executes the operation in the client. One aspect to consider is whether the data is large enough to require processing in the server, at least initially, or small enough to be sent to the client cheaply. Another factor is whether the data needs to be processed atomically: getting the state and calling do_something_expensive(state) outside of the agent means that the agent's state can be updated in the meantime. This is specially important in case of updates as computing the new state in the client rather than in the server can lead to race conditions if multiple clients are trying to update the same state to different values. How to supervise An Agent is most commonly started under a supervision tree. When we invoke use Agent , it automatically defines a child_spec/1 function that allows us to start the agent directly under a supervisor. To start an agent under a supervisor with an initial counter of 0, one may do: children = [ { Counter , 0 } ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_all ) While one could also simply pass the Counter as a child to the supervisor, such as: children = [ Counter # Same as {Counter, []} ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_all ) The definition above wouldn't work for this particular example, as it would attempt to start the counter with an initial value of an empty list. However, this may be a viable option in your own agents. A common approach is to use a keyword list, as that would allow setting the initial value and giving a name to the counter process, for example: def start_link ( opts ) do { initial_value , opts } = Keyword . pop ( opts , :initial_value , 0 ) Agent . start_link ( fn -&gt; initial_value end , opts ) end and then you can use Counter , {Counter, name: :my_counter} or even {Counter, initial_value: 0, name: :my_counter} as a child specification. use Agent also accepts a list of options which configures the child specification and therefore how it runs under a supervisor. The generated child_spec/1 can be customized with the following options: :id - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module :restart - when the child should be restarted, defaults to :permanent :shutdown - how to shut down the child, either immediately or by giving it time to shut down For example: use Agent , restart : :transient , shutdown : 10_000 See the &quot;Child specification&quot; section in the Supervisor module for more detailed information. The @doc annotation immediately preceding use Agent will be attached to the generated child_spec/1 function. Name registration An agent is bound to the same name registration rules as GenServers. Read more about it in the GenServer documentation. A word on distributed agents It is important to consider the limitations of distributed agents. Agents provide two APIs, one that works with anonymous functions and another that expects an explicit module, function, and arguments. In a distributed setup with multiple nodes, the API that accepts anonymous functions only works if the caller (client) and the agent have the same version of the caller module. Keep in mind this issue also shows up when performing &quot;rolling upgrades&quot; with agents. By rolling upgrades we mean the following situation: you wish to deploy a new version of your software by shutting down some of your nodes and replacing them with nodes running a new version of the software. In this setup, part of your environment will have one version of a given module and the other part another version (the newer one) of the same module. The best solution is to simply use the explicit module, function, and arguments APIs when working with distributed agents. Hot code swapping An agent can have its code hot swapped live by simply passing a module, function, and arguments tuple to the update instruction. For example, imagine you have an agent named :sample and you want to convert its inner state from a keyword list to a map. It can be done with the following instruction: { :update , :sample , { :advanced , { Enum , :into , [ %{ } ] } } } The agent's state will be added to the given list of arguments ( [%{}] ) as the first argument.","ref":"Agent.html","source_doc":"Agents are a simple abstraction around state.\n\nOften in Elixir there is a need to share or store state that\nmust be accessed from different processes or by the same process\nat different points in time.\n\nThe `Agent` module provides a basic server implementation that\nallows state to be retrieved and updated via a simple API.\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example, the following agent implements a counter:\n\n    defmodule Counter do\n      use Agent\n\n      def start_link(initial_value) do\n        Agent.start_link(fn -> initial_value end, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      def value do\n        Agent.get(__MODULE__, & &1)\n      end\n\n      def increment do\n        Agent.update(__MODULE__, &(&1 + 1))\n      end\n    end\n\nUsage would be:\n\n    Counter.start_link(0)\n    #=> {:ok, #PID<0.123.0>}\n\n    Counter.value()\n    #=> 0\n\n    Counter.increment()\n    #=> :ok\n\n    Counter.increment()\n    #=> :ok\n\n    Counter.value()\n    #=> 2\n\nThanks to the agent server process, the counter can be safely incremented\nconcurrently.\n\nAgents provide a segregation between the client and server APIs (similar to\n`GenServer`s). In particular, the functions passed as arguments to the calls to\n`Agent` functions are invoked inside the agent (the server). This distinction\nis important because you may want to avoid expensive operations inside the\nagent, as they will effectively block the agent until the request is\nfulfilled.\n\nConsider these two examples:\n\n    # Compute in the agent/server\n    def get_something(agent) do\n      Agent.get(agent, fn state -> do_something_expensive(state) end)\n    end\n\n    # Compute in the agent/client\n    def get_something(agent) do\n      Agent.get(agent, & &1) |> do_something_expensive()\n    end\n\nThe first function blocks the agent. The second function copies all the state\nto the client and then executes the operation in the client. One aspect to\nconsider is whether the data is large enough to require processing in the server,\nat least initially, or small enough to be sent to the client cheaply. Another\nfactor is whether the data needs to be processed atomically: getting the\nstate and calling `do_something_expensive(state)` outside of the agent means\nthat the agent's state can be updated in the meantime. This is specially\nimportant in case of updates as computing the new state in the client rather\nthan in the server can lead to race conditions if multiple clients are trying\nto update the same state to different values.\n\n## How to supervise\n\nAn `Agent` is most commonly started under a supervision tree.\nWhen we invoke `use Agent`, it automatically defines a `child_spec/1`\nfunction that allows us to start the agent directly under a supervisor.\nTo start an agent under a supervisor with an initial counter of 0,\none may do:\n\n    children = [\n      {Counter, 0}\n    ]\n\n    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_all)\n\nWhile one could also simply pass the `Counter` as a child to the supervisor,\nsuch as:\n\n    children = [\n      Counter # Same as {Counter, []}\n    ]\n\n    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_all)\n\nThe definition above wouldn't work for this particular example,\nas it would attempt to start the counter with an initial value\nof an empty list. However, this may be a viable option in your\nown agents. A common approach is to use a keyword list, as that\nwould allow setting the initial value and giving a name to the\ncounter process, for example:\n\n    def start_link(opts) do\n      {initial_value, opts} = Keyword.pop(opts, :initial_value, 0)\n      Agent.start_link(fn -> initial_value end, opts)\n    end\n\nand then you can use `Counter`, `{Counter, name: :my_counter}` or\neven `{Counter, initial_value: 0, name: :my_counter}` as a child\nspecification.\n\n`use Agent` also accepts a list of options which configures the\nchild specification and therefore how it runs under a supervisor.\nThe generated `child_spec/1` can be customized with the following options:\n\n  * `:id` - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module\n  * `:restart` - when the child should be restarted, defaults to `:permanent`\n  * `:shutdown` - how to shut down the child, either immediately or by giving it time to shut down\n\nFor example:\n\n    use Agent, restart: :transient, shutdown: 10_000\n\nSee the \"Child specification\" section in the `Supervisor` module for more\ndetailed information. The `@doc` annotation immediately preceding\n`use Agent` will be attached to the generated `child_spec/1` function.\n\n## Name registration\n\nAn agent is bound to the same name registration rules as GenServers.\nRead more about it in the `GenServer` documentation.\n\n## A word on distributed agents\n\nIt is important to consider the limitations of distributed agents. Agents\nprovide two APIs, one that works with anonymous functions and another\nthat expects an explicit module, function, and arguments.\n\nIn a distributed setup with multiple nodes, the API that accepts anonymous\nfunctions only works if the caller (client) and the agent have the same\nversion of the caller module.\n\nKeep in mind this issue also shows up when performing \"rolling upgrades\"\nwith agents.

Applications are the idiomatic way to package software in Erlang/OTP. To get the idea, they are similar to the &quot;library&quot; concept common in other programming languages, but with some additional characteristics. An application is a component implementing some specific functionality, with a standardized directory structure, configuration, and life cycle. Applications are loaded , started , and stopped . Each application also has its own environment, which provides a unified API for configuring each application. Developers typically interact with the application environment and its callback module. Therefore those will be the topics we will cover first before jumping into details about the application resource file and life-cycle. The application environment Each application has its own environment. The environment is a keyword list that maps atoms to terms. Note that this environment is unrelated to the operating system environment. By default, the environment of an application is an empty list. In a Mix project's mix.exs file, you can set the :env key in application/0 : def application do [ env : [ db_host : &quot;localhost&quot; ] ] end Now, in your application, you can read this environment by using functions such as fetch_env!/2 and friends: defmodule MyApp.DBClient do def start_link ( ) do SomeLib.DBClient . start_link ( host : db_host ( ) ) end defp db_host do Application . fetch_env! ( :my_app , :db_host ) end end In Mix projects, the environment of the application and its dependencies can be overridden via the config/config.exs and config/runtime.exs files. The former is loaded at build-time, before your code compiles, and the latter at runtime, just before your app starts. For example, someone using your application can override its :db_host environment variable as follows: import Config config :my_app , :db_host , &quot;db.local&quot; See the &quot;Configuration&quot; section in the Mix module for more information. You can also change the application environment dynamically by using functions such as put_env/3 and delete_env/2 . Environment in libraries The config files config/config.exs and config/runtime.exs are rarely used by libraries. Libraries typically define their environment in the application/0 function of their mix.exs . Configuration files are rather used by applications to configure their libraries. Reading the environment of other applications Each application is responsible for its own environment. Do not use the functions in this module for directly accessing or modifying the environment of other applications. Whenever you change the application environment, Elixir's build tool will only recompile the files that belong to that application. So if you read the application environment of another application, there is a chance you will be depending on outdated configuration, as your file won't be recompiled as it changes. Compile-time environment In the previous example, we read the application environment at runtime: defmodule MyApp.DBClient do def start_link ( ) do SomeLib.DBClient . start_link ( host : db_host ( ) ) end defp db_host do Application . fetch_env! ( :my_app , :db_host ) end end In other words, the environment key :db_host for application :my_app will only be read when MyApp.DBClient effectively starts. While reading the application environment at runtime is the preferred approach, in some rare occasions you may want to use the application environment to configure the compilation of a certain project. However, if you try to access Application.fetch_env!/2 outside of a function: defmodule MyApp.DBClient do @db_host Application . fetch_env! ( :my_app , :db_host ) def start_link ( ) do SomeLib.DBClient . start_link ( host : @db_host ) end end You might see warnings and errors: warning : Application . fetch_env! / 2 is discouraged in the module body , use Application . compile_env / 3 instead iex : 3 : MyApp.DBClient ** (ArgumentError) could not fetch application environment :db_host for application :my_app because the application was not loaded nor configured This happens because, when defining modules, the application environment is not yet available. Luckily, the warning tells us how to solve this issue, by using Application.compile_env/3 instead: defmodule MyApp.DBClient do @db_host Application . compile_env ( :my_app , :db_host , &quot;db.local&quot; ) def start_link ( ) do SomeLib.DBClient . start_link ( host : @db_host ) end end The difference here is that compile_env expects the default value to be given as an argument, instead of using the def application function of your mix.exs . Furthermore, by using compile_env/3 , tools like Mix will store the values used during compilation and compare the compilation values with the runtime values whenever your system starts, raising an error in case they differ. In any case, compile-time environments should be avoided. Whenever possible, reading the application environment at runtime should be the first choice. The application callback module Applications can be loaded, started, and stopped. Generally, build tools like Mix take care of starting an application and all of its dependencies for you, but you can also do it manually by calling: { :ok , _ } = Application . ensure_all_started ( :some_app ) When an application starts, developers may configure a callback module that executes custom code. Developers use this callback to start the application supervision tree. The first step to do so is to add a :mod key to the application/0 definition in your mix.exs file. It expects a tuple, with the application callback module and start argument (commonly an empty list): def application do [ mod : { MyApp , [ ] } ] end The MyApp module given to :mod needs to implement the Application behaviour. This can be done by putting use Application in that module and implementing the start/2 callback, for example: defmodule MyApp do use Application def start ( _type , _args ) do children = [ ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) end end The start/2 callback has to spawn and link a supervisor and return {:ok, pid} or {:ok, pid, state} , where pid is the PID of the supervisor, and state is an optional application state. args is the second element of the tuple given to the :mod option. The type argument passed to start/2 is usually :normal unless in a distributed setup where application takeovers and failovers are configured. Distributed applications are beyond the scope of this documentation. When an application is shutting down, its stop/1 callback is called after the supervision tree has been stopped by the runtime. This callback allows the application to do any final cleanup. The argument is the state returned by start/2 , if it did, or [] otherwise. The return value of stop/1 is ignored. By using Application , modules get a default implementation of stop/1 that ignores its argument and returns :ok , but it can be overridden. Application callback modules may also implement the optional callback prep_stop/1 . If present, prep_stop/1 is invoked before the supervision tree is terminated. Its argument is the state returned by start/2 , if it did, or [] otherwise, and its return value is passed to stop/1 . The application resource file In the sections above, we have configured an application in the application/0 section of the mix.exs file. Ultimately, Mix will use this configuration to create an application resource file , which is a file called APP_NAME.app . For example, the application resource file of the OTP application ex_unit is called ex_unit.app . You can learn more about the generation of application resource files in the documentation of Mix.Tasks.Compile.App , available as well by running mix help compile.app . The application life cycle Loading applications Applications are loaded , which means that the runtime finds and processes their resource files: Application . load ( :ex_unit ) #=&gt; :ok When an application is loaded, the environment specified in its resource file is merged with any overrides from config files. Loading an application does not load its modules. In practice, you rarely load applications by hand because that is part of the start process, explained next. Starting applications Applications are also started : Application . start ( :ex_unit ) #=&gt; :ok Once your application is compiled, running your system is a matter of starting your current application and its dependencies. Differently from other languages, Elixir does not have a main procedure that is responsible for starting your system. Instead, you start one or more applications, each with their own initialization and termination logic. When an application is started, the Application.load/1 is automatically invoked if it hasn't been done yet. Then, it checks if the dependencies listed in the applications key of the resource file are already started. Having at least one dependency not started is an error condition. Functions like ensure_all_started/1 takes care of starting an application and all of its dependencies for you. If the application does not have a callback module configured, starting is done at this point. Otherwise, its start/2 callback is invoked. The PID of the top-level supervisor returned by this function is stored by the runtime for later use, and the returned application state is saved too, if any. Stopping applications Started applications are, finally, stopped : Application . stop ( :ex_unit ) #=&gt; :ok Stopping an application without a callback module is defined, but except for some system tracing, it is in practice a no-op. Stopping an application with a callback module has three steps: If present, invoke the optional callback prep_stop/1 . Terminate the top-level supervisor. Invoke the required callback stop/1 . The arguments passed to the callbacks are related to the state optionally returned by start/2 , and are documented in the section about the callback module above. It is important to highlight that step 2 is a blocking one. Termination of a supervisor triggers a recursive chain of children terminations, therefore orderly shutting down all descendant processes. The stop/1 callback is invoked only after termination of the whole supervision tree. Shutting down a live system cleanly can be done by calling System.stop/1 . It will shut down every application in the opposite order they had been started. By default, a SIGTERM from the operating system will automatically translate to System.stop/0 . You can also have more explicit control over operating system signals via the :os.set_signal/2 function. Tooling The Mix build tool automates most of the application management tasks. For example, mix test automatically starts your application dependencies and your application itself before your test runs. mix run --no-halt boots your current project and can be used to start a long running system. See mix help run . Developers can also use mix release to build releases . Releases are able to package all of your source code as well as the Erlang VM into a single directory. Releases also give you explicit control over how each application is started and in which order. They also provide a more streamlined mechanism for starting and stopping systems, debugging, logging, as well as system monitoring. Finally, Elixir provides tools such as escripts and archives, which are different mechanisms for packaging your application. Those are typically used when tools must be shared between developers and not as deployment options. See mix help archive.build and mix help escript.build for more detail. Further information For further details on applications please check the documentation of the :application Erlang module , and the Applications section of the OTP Design Principles User's Guide .","ref":"Application.html","source_doc":"A module for working with applications and defining application callbacks.\n\nApplications are the idiomatic way to package software in Erlang/OTP. To get\nthe idea, they are similar to the \"library\" concept common in other\nprogramming languages, but with some additional characteristics.\n\nAn application is a component implementing some specific functionality, with a\nstandardized directory structure, configuration, and life cycle. Applications\nare *loaded*, *started*, and *stopped*. Each application also has its own\nenvironment, which provides a unified API for configuring each application.\n\nDevelopers typically interact with the application environment and its\ncallback module. Therefore those will be the topics we will cover first\nbefore jumping into details about the application resource file and life-cycle.\n\n## The application environment\n\nEach application has its own environment. The environment is a keyword list\nthat maps atoms to terms. Note that this environment is unrelated to the\noperating system environment.\n\nBy default, the environment of an application is an empty list. In a Mix\nproject's `mix.exs` file, you can set the `:env` key in `application/0`:\n\n    def application do\n      [env: [db_host: \"localhost\"]]\n    end\n\nNow, in your application, you can read this environment by using functions\nsuch as `fetch_env!/2` and friends:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.DBClient do\n      def start_link() do\n        SomeLib.DBClient.start_link(host: db_host())\n      end\n\n      defp db_host do\n        Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, :db_host)\n      end\n    end\n\nIn Mix projects, the environment of the application and its dependencies can\nbe overridden via the `config/config.exs` and `config/runtime.exs` files. The\nformer is loaded at build-time, before your code compiles, and the latter at\nruntime, just before your app starts. For example, someone using your application\ncan override its `:db_host` environment variable as follows:\n\n    import Config\n    config :my_app, :db_host, \"db.local\"\n\nSee the \"Configuration\" section in the `Mix` module for more information.\nYou can also change the application environment dynamically by using functions\nsuch as `put_env/3` and `delete_env/2`.\n\n> #### Environment in libraries {: .tip}\n>\n> The config files `config/config.exs` and `config/runtime.exs`\n> are rarely used by libraries. Libraries typically define their environment\n> in the `application/0` function of their `mix.exs`. Configuration files\n> are rather used by applications to configure their libraries.\n\n> #### Reading the environment of other applications {: .warning}\n>\n> Each application is responsible for its own environment. Do not\n> use the functions in this module for directly accessing or modifying\n> the environment of other applications. Whenever you change the application\n> environment, Elixir's build tool will only recompile the files that\n> belong to that application. So if you read the application environment\n> of another application, there is a chance you will be depending on\n> outdated configuration, as your file won't be recompiled as it changes.\n\n## Compile-time environment\n\nIn the previous example, we read the application environment at runtime:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.DBClient do\n      def start_link() do\n        SomeLib.DBClient.start_link(host: db_host())\n      end\n\n      defp db_host do\n        Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, :db_host)\n      end\n    end\n\nIn other words, the environment key `:db_host` for application `:my_app`\nwill only be read when `MyApp.DBClient` effectively starts. While reading\nthe application environment at runtime is the preferred approach, in some\nrare occasions you may want to use the application environment to configure\nthe compilation of a certain project. However, if you try to access\n`Application.fetch_env!/2` outside of a function:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.DBClient do\n      @db_host Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, :db_host)\n\n      def start_link() do\n        SomeLib.DBClient.start_link(host: @db_host)\n      end\n    end\n\nYou might see warnings and errors:\n\n    warning: Application.fetch_env!/2 is discouraged in the module body,\n    use Application.compile_env/3 instead\n      iex:3: MyApp.DBClient\n\n    ** (ArgumentError) could not fetch application environment :db_host\n    for application :my_app because the application was not loaded nor\n    configured\n\nThis happens because, when defining modules, the application environment\nis not yet available. Luckily, the warning tells us how to solve this\nissue, by using `Application.compile_env/3` instead:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.DBClient do\n      @db_host Application.compile_env(:my_app, :db_host, \"db.local\")\n\n      def start_link() do\n        SomeLib.DBClient.start_link(host: @db_host)\n      end\n    end\n\nThe difference here is that `compile_env` expects the default value to be\ngiven as an argument, instead of using the `def application` function of\nyour `mix.exs`. Furthermore, by using `compile_env/3`, tools like Mix will\nstore the values used during compilation and compare the compilation values\nwith the runtime values whenever your system starts, raising an error in\ncase they differ.\n\nIn any case, compile-time environments should be avoided. Whenever possible,\nreading the application environment at runtime should be the first choice.\n\n## The application callback module\n\nApplications can be loaded, started, and stopped. Generally, build tools\nlike Mix take care of starting an application and all of its dependencies\nfor you, but you can also do it manually by calling:\n\n    {:ok, _} = Application.ensure_all_started(:some_app)\n\nWhen an application starts, developers may configure a callback module\nthat executes custom code. Developers use this callback to start the\napplication supervision tree.\n\nThe first step to do so is to add a `:mod` key to the `application/0`\ndefinition in your `mix.exs` file. It expects a tuple, with the application\ncallback module and start argument (commonly an empty list):\n\n    def application do\n      [mod: {MyApp, []}]\n    end\n\nThe `MyApp` module given to `:mod` needs to implement the `Application` behaviour.\nThis can be done by putting `use Application` in that module and implementing the\n`c:start/2` callback, for example:\n\n    defmodule MyApp do\n      use Application\n\n      def start(_type, _args) do\n        children = []\n        Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\n      end\n    end\n\nThe `c:start/2` callback has to spawn and link a supervisor and return `{:ok,\npid}` or `{:ok, pid, state}`, where `pid` is the PID of the supervisor, and\n`state` is an optional application state. `args` is the second element of the\ntuple given to the `:mod` option.\n\nThe `type` argument passed to `c:start/2` is usually `:normal` unless in a\ndistributed setup where application takeovers and failovers are configured.\nDistributed applications are beyond the scope of this documentation.\n\nWhen an application is shutting down, its `c:stop/1` callback is called after\nthe supervision tree has been stopped by the runtime. This callback allows the\napplication to do any final cleanup. The argument is the state returned by\n`c:start/2`, if it did, or `[]` otherwise. The return value of `c:stop/1` is\nignored.\n\nBy using `Application`, modules get a default implementation of `c:stop/1`\nthat ignores its argument and returns `:ok`, but it can be overridden.\n\nApplication callback modules may also implement the optional callback\n`c:prep_stop/1`. If present, `c:prep_stop/1` is invoked before the supervision\ntree is terminated. Its argument is the state returned by `c:start/2`, if it did,\nor `[]` otherwise, and its return value is passed to `c:stop/1`.\n\n## The application resource file\n\nIn the sections above, we have configured an application in the\n`application/0` section of the `mix.exs` file. Ultimately, Mix will use\nthis configuration to create an [*application resource\nfile*](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/application.html), which is a file called\n`APP_NAME.app`. For example, the application resource file of the OTP\napplication `ex_unit` is called `ex_unit.app`.\n\nYou can learn more about the generation of application resource files in\nthe documentation of `Mix.Tasks.Compile.App`, available as well by running\n`mix help compile.app`.\n\n## The application life cycle\n\n### Loading applications\n\nApplications are *loaded*, which means that the runtime finds and processes\ntheir resource files:\n\n    Application.load(:ex_unit)\n    #=> :ok\n\nWhen an application is loaded, the environment specified in its resource file\nis merged with any overrides from config files.\n\nLoading an application *does not* load its modules.\n\nIn practice, you rarely load applications by hand because that is part of the\nstart process, explained next.\n\n### Starting applications\n\nApplications are also *started*:\n\n    Application.start(:ex_unit)\n    #=> :ok\n\nOnce your application is compiled, running your system is a matter of starting\nyour current application and its dependencies. Differently from other languages,\nElixir does not have a `main` procedure that is responsible for starting your\nsystem. Instead, you start one or more applications, each with their own\ninitialization and termination logic.\n\nWhen an application is started, the `Application.load/1` is automatically\ninvoked if it hasn't been done yet. Then, it checks if the dependencies listed\nin the `applications` key of the resource file are already started. Having at\nleast one dependency not started is an error condition. Functions like\n`ensure_all_started/1` takes care of starting an application and all of its\ndependencies for you.\n\nIf the application does not have a callback module configured, starting is\ndone at this point. Otherwise, its `c:start/2` callback is invoked. The PID of\nthe top-level supervisor returned by this function is stored by the runtime\nfor later use, and the returned application state is saved too, if any.\n\n### Stopping applications\n\nStarted applications are, finally, *stopped*:\n\n    Application.stop(:ex_unit)\n    #=> :ok\n\nStopping an application without a callback module is defined, but except for\nsome system tracing, it is in practice a no-op.\n\nStopping an application with a callback module has three steps:\n\n  1. If present, invoke the optional callback `c:prep_stop/1`.\n  2. Terminate the top-level supervisor.\n  3. Invoke the required callback `c:stop/1`.\n\nThe arguments passed to the callbacks are related to the state optionally\nreturned by `c:start/2`, and are documented in the section about the callback\nmodule above.\n\nIt is important to highlight that step 2 is a blocking one. Termination of a\nsupervisor triggers a recursive chain of children terminations, therefore\norderly shutting down all descendant processes. The `c:stop/1` callback is\ninvoked only after termination of the whole supervision tree.\n\nShutting down a live system cleanly can be done by calling `System.stop/1`. It\nwill shut down every application in the opposite order they had been started.\n\nBy default, a SIGTERM from the operating system will automatically translate to\n`System.stop/0`. You can also have more explicit control over operating system\nsignals via the `:os.set_signal/2` function.\n\n## Tooling\n\nThe Mix build tool automates most of the application management tasks. For example,\n`mix test` automatically starts your application dependencies and your application\nitself before your test runs. `mix run --no-halt` boots your current project and\ncan be used to start a long running system. See `mix help run`.\n\nDevelopers can also use `mix release` to build **releases**. Releases are able to\npackage all of your source code as well as the Erlang VM into a single directory.\nReleases also give you explicit control over how each application is started and in\nwhich order. They also provide a more streamlined mechanism for starting and\nstopping systems, debugging, logging, as well as system monitoring.\n\nFinally, Elixir provides tools such as escripts and archives, which are\ndifferent mechanisms for packaging your application. Those are typically used\nwhen tools must be shared between developers and not as deployment options.\nSee `mix help archive.build` and `mix help escript.build` for more detail.\n\n## Further information\n\nFor further details on applications please check the documentation of the\n[`:application` Erlang module](`:application`), and the\n[Applications](https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html)\nsection of the [OTP Design Principles User's\nGuide](https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/users_guide.html).\n","title":"Application","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"Gets the directory for app. This information is returned based on the code path.

Multiple config files One common use of config providers is to specify multiple configuration files in a release.

The Supervisor module was designed to handle mostly static children that are started in the given order when the supervisor starts. A DynamicSupervisor starts with no children.

This allows the DynamicSupervisor to hold millions of children by using efficient data structures and to execute certain operations, such as shutting down, concurrently. Examples A dynamic supervisor is started with no children and often a name: children = [ { DynamicSupervisor , name : MyApp.DynamicSupervisor , strategy : :one_for_one } ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) The options given in the child specification are documented in start_link/1 .

To address this, you can start multiple instances of the DynamicSupervisor and then pick a &quot;random&quot; instance to start the child on. Instead of: children = [ { DynamicSupervisor , name : MyApp.DynamicSupervisor } ] and: DynamicSupervisor . start_child ( MyApp.DynamicSupervisor , { Counter , 0 } ) You can do this: children = [ { PartitionSupervisor , child_spec : DynamicSupervisor , name : MyApp.DynamicSupervisors } ] and then: DynamicSupervisor . start_child ( { :via , PartitionSupervisor , { MyApp.DynamicSupervisors , self ( ) } } , { Counter , 0 } ) In the code above, we start a partition supervisor that will by default start a dynamic supervisor for each core in your machine. Then, instead of calling the DynamicSupervisor by name, you call it through the partition supervisor, using self() as the routing key. This means each process will be assigned one of the existing dynamic supervisors. Read the PartitionSupervisor docs for more information.

A @doc annotation immediately preceding use DynamicSupervisor will be attached to the generated child_spec/1 function. Name registration A supervisor is bound to the same name registration rules as a GenServer . Read more about these rules in the documentation for GenServer . Migrating from Supervisor's :simple_one_for_one In case you were using the deprecated :simple_one_for_one strategy from the Supervisor module, you can migrate to the DynamicSupervisor in few steps.

A `@doc` annotation immediately preceding\n`use DynamicSupervisor` will be attached to the generated `child_spec/1`\nfunction.\n\n## Name registration\n\nA supervisor is bound to the same name registration rules as a `GenServer`.\nRead more about these rules in the documentation for `GenServer`.\n\n## Migrating from Supervisor's :simple_one_for_one\n\nIn case you were using the deprecated `:simple_one_for_one` strategy from\nthe `Supervisor` module, you can migrate to the `DynamicSupervisor` in\nfew steps.\n\nImagine the given \"old\" code:\n\n    defmodule MySupervisor do\n      use Supervisor\n\n      def start_link(init_arg) do\n        Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, init_arg, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      def start_child(foo, bar, baz) do\n        # This will start child by calling MyWorker.start_link(init_arg, foo, bar, baz)\n        Supervisor.start_child(__MODULE__, [foo, bar, baz])\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def init(init_arg) do\n        children = [\n          # Or the deprecated: worker(MyWorker, [init_arg])\n          %{id: MyWorker, start: {MyWorker, :start_link, [init_arg]}}\n        ]\n\n        Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :simple_one_for_one)\n      end\n    end\n\nIt can be upgraded to the DynamicSupervisor like this:\n\n    defmodule MySupervisor do\n      use DynamicSupervisor\n\n      def start_link(init_arg) do\n        DynamicSupervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, init_arg, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      def start_child(foo, bar, baz) do\n        # If MyWorker is not using the new child specs, we need to pass a map:\n        # spec = %{id: MyWorker, start: {MyWorker, :start_link, [foo, bar, baz]}}\n        spec = {MyWorker, foo: foo, bar: bar, baz: baz}\n        DynamicSupervisor.start_child(__MODULE__, spec)\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def init(init_arg) do\n        DynamicSupervisor.init(\n          strategy: :one_for_one,\n          extra_arguments: [init_arg]\n        )\n      end\n    end\n\nThe difference is that the `DynamicSupervisor` expects the child specification\nat the moment `start_child/2` is called, and no longer on the init callback.\nIf there are any initial arguments given on initialization, such as `[initial_arg]`,\nit can be given in the `:extra_arguments` flag on `DynamicSupervisor.init/1`.\n","title":"DynamicSupervisor","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"Returns a specification to start a dynamic supervisor under a supervisor.

A GenServer is a process like any other Elixir process and it can be used to keep state, execute code asynchronously and so on. The advantage of using a generic server process (GenServer) implemented using this module is that it will have a standard set of interface functions and include functionality for tracing and error reporting. It will also fit into a supervision tree. Example The GenServer behaviour abstracts the common client-server interaction. Developers are only required to implement the callbacks and functionality they are interested in. Let's start with a code example and then explore the available callbacks. Imagine we want to implement a service with a GenServer that works like a stack, allowing us to push and pop elements. We'll customize a generic GenServer with our own module by implementing three callbacks. init/1 transforms our initial argument to the initial state for the GenServer. handle_call/3 fires when the server receives a synchronous pop message, popping an element from the stack and returning it to the user. handle_cast/2 will fire when the server receives an asynchronous push message, pushing an element onto the stack: defmodule Stack do use GenServer # Callbacks @impl true def init ( elements ) do initial_state = String . split ( elements , &quot;,&quot; , trim : true ) { :ok , initial_state } end @impl true def handle_call ( :pop , _from , state ) do [ to_caller | new_state ] = state { :reply , to_caller , new_state } end @impl true def handle_cast ( { :push , element } , state ) do new_state = [ element | state ] { :noreply , new_state } end end We leave the process machinery of startup, message passing, and the message loop to the GenServer behaviour and focus only on the stack implementation. We can now use the GenServer API to interact with the service by creating a process and sending it messages: # Start the server { :ok , pid } = GenServer . start_link ( Stack , &quot;hello,world&quot; ) # This is the client GenServer . call ( pid , :pop ) #=&gt; &quot;hello&quot; GenServer . cast ( pid , { :push , &quot;elixir&quot; } ) #=&gt; :ok GenServer . call ( pid , :pop ) #=&gt; &quot;elixir&quot; We start our Stack by calling start_link/2 , passing the module with the server implementation and its initial argument with a comma-separated list of elements. The GenServer behaviour calls the init/1 callback to establish the initial GenServer state. From this point on, the GenServer has control so we interact with it by sending two types of messages on the client. call messages expect a reply from the server (and are therefore synchronous) while cast messages do not. Each call to GenServer.call/3 results in a message that must be handled by the handle_call/3 callback in the GenServer. A cast/2 message must be handled by handle_cast/2 . GenServer supports 8 callbacks, but only init/1 is required. Client / Server APIs Although in the example above we have used GenServer.start_link/3 and friends to directly start and communicate with the server, most of the time we don't call the GenServer functions directly. Instead, we wrap the calls in new functions representing the public API of the server. These thin wrappers are called the client API . Here is a better implementation of our Stack module: defmodule Stack do use GenServer # Client def start_link ( default ) when is_binary ( default ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , default ) end def push ( pid , element ) do GenServer . cast ( pid , { :push , element } ) end def pop ( pid ) do GenServer . call ( pid , :pop ) end # Server (callbacks) @impl true def init ( elements ) do initial_state = String . split ( elements , &quot;,&quot; , trim : true ) { :ok , initial_state } end @impl true def handle_call ( :pop , _from , state ) do [ to_caller | new_state ] = state { :reply , to_caller , new_state } end @impl true def handle_cast ( { :push , element } , state ) do new_state = [ element | state ] { :noreply , new_state } end end In practice, it is common to have both server and client functions in the same module. If the server and/or client implementations are growing complex, you may want to have them in different modules. How to supervise A GenServer is most commonly started under a supervision tree. When we invoke use GenServer , it automatically defines a child_spec/1 function that allows us to start the Stack directly under a supervisor. To start a default stack of [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;] under a supervisor, we can do: children = [ { Stack , &quot;hello,world&quot; } ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_all ) Note that specifying a module MyServer would be the same as specifying the tuple {MyServer, []} . use GenServer also accepts a list of options which configures the child specification and therefore how it runs under a supervisor. The generated child_spec/1 can be customized with the following options: :id - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module :restart - when the child should be restarted, defaults to :permanent :shutdown - how to shut down the child, either immediately or by giving it time to shut down For example: use GenServer , restart : :transient , shutdown : 10_000 See the &quot;Child specification&quot; section in the Supervisor module for more detailed information. The @doc annotation immediately preceding use GenServer will be attached to the generated child_spec/1 function. When stopping the GenServer, for example by returning a {:stop, reason, new_state} tuple from a callback, the exit reason is used by the supervisor to determine whether the GenServer needs to be restarted. See the &quot;Exit reasons and restarts&quot; section in the Supervisor module. Name registration Both start_link/3 and start/3 support the GenServer to register a name on start via the :name option. Registered names are also automatically cleaned up on termination. The supported values are: an atom - the GenServer is registered locally (to the current node) with the given name using Process.register/2 . {:global, term} - the GenServer is registered globally with the given term using the functions in the :global module . {:via, module, term} - the GenServer is registered with the given mechanism and name. The :via option expects a module that exports register_name/2 , unregister_name/1 , whereis_name/1 and send/2 . One such example is the :global module which uses these functions for keeping the list of names of processes and their associated PIDs that are available globally for a network of Elixir nodes. Elixir also ships with a local, decentralized and scalable registry called Registry for locally storing names that are generated dynamically. For example, we could start and register our Stack server locally as follows: # Start the server and register it locally with name MyStack { :ok , _ } = GenServer . start_link ( Stack , &quot;hello&quot; , name : MyStack ) # Now messages can be sent directly to MyStack GenServer . call ( MyStack , :pop ) #=&gt; &quot;hello&quot; Once the server is started, the remaining functions in this module ( call/3 , cast/2 , and friends) will also accept an atom, or any {:global, ...} or {:via, ...} tuples. In general, the following formats are supported: a PID an atom if the server is locally registered {atom, node} if the server is locally registered at another node {:global, term} if the server is globally registered {:via, module, name} if the server is registered through an alternative registry If there is an interest to register dynamic names locally, do not use atoms, as atoms are never garbage-collected and therefore dynamically generated atoms won't be garbage-collected. For such cases, you can set up your own local registry by using the Registry module. Receiving &quot;regular&quot; messages The goal of a GenServer is to abstract the &quot;receive&quot; loop for developers, automatically handling system messages, supporting code change, synchronous calls and more. Therefore, you should never call your own &quot;receive&quot; inside the GenServer callbacks as doing so will cause the GenServer to misbehave. Besides the synchronous and asynchronous communication provided by call/3 and cast/2 , &quot;regular&quot; messages sent by functions such as send/2 , Process.send_after/4 and similar, can be handled inside the handle_info/2 callback. handle_info/2 can be used in many situations, such as handling monitor DOWN messages sent by Process.monitor/1 . Another use case for handle_info/2 is to perform periodic work, with the help of Process.send_after/4 : defmodule MyApp.Periodically do use GenServer def start_link ( _ ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , %{ } ) end @impl true def init ( state ) do # Schedule work to be performed on start schedule_work ( ) { :ok , state } end @impl true def handle_info ( :work , state ) do # Do the desired work here # ... # Reschedule once more schedule_work ( ) { :noreply , state } end defp schedule_work do # We schedule the work to happen in 2 hours (written in milliseconds). # Alternatively, one might write :timer.hours(2) Process . send_after ( self ( ) , :work , 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) end end Timeouts The return value of init/1 or any of the handle_* callbacks may include a timeout value in milliseconds; if not, :infinity is assumed. The timeout can be used to detect a lull in incoming messages. The timeout() value is used as follows: If the process has any message already waiting when the timeout() value is returned, the timeout is ignored and the waiting message is handled as usual. This means that even a timeout of 0 milliseconds is not guaranteed to execute (if you want to take another action immediately and unconditionally, use a :continue instruction instead). If any message arrives before the specified number of milliseconds elapse, the timeout is cleared and that message is handled as usual. Otherwise, when the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed with no message arriving, handle_info/2 is called with :timeout as the first argument. When (not) to use a GenServer So far, we have learned that a GenServer can be used as a supervised process that handles sync and async calls. It can also handle system messages, such as periodic messages and monitoring events. GenServer processes may also be named. A GenServer, or a process in general, must be used to model runtime characteristics of your system. A GenServer must never be used for code organization purposes. In Elixir, code organization is done by modules and functions, processes are not necessary. For example, imagine you are implementing a calculator and you decide to put all the calculator operations behind a GenServer: def add ( a , b ) do GenServer . call ( __MODULE__ , { :add , a , b } ) end def subtract ( a , b ) do GenServer . call ( __MODULE__ , { :subtract , a , b } ) end def handle_call ( { :add , a , b } , _from , state ) do { :reply , a + b , state } end def handle_call ( { :subtract , a , b } , _from , state ) do { :reply , a - b , state } end This is an anti-pattern not only because it convolutes the calculator logic but also because you put the calculator logic behind a single process that will potentially become a bottleneck in your system, especially as the number of calls grow. Instead just define the functions directly: def add ( a , b ) do a + b end def subtract ( a , b ) do a - b end If you don't need a process, then you don't need a process. Use processes only to model runtime properties, such as mutable state, concurrency and failures, never for code organization. Debugging with the :sys module GenServers, as special processes , can be debugged using the :sys module . Through various hooks, this module allows developers to introspect the state of the process and trace system events that happen during its execution, such as received messages, sent replies and state changes. Let's explore the basic functions from the :sys module used for debugging: :sys.get_state/2 - allows retrieval of the state of the process. In the case of a GenServer process, it will be the callback module state, as passed into the callback functions as last argument. :sys.get_status/2 - allows retrieval of the status of the process. This status includes the process dictionary, if the process is running or is suspended, the parent PID, the debugger state, and the state of the behaviour module, which includes the callback module state (as returned by :sys.get_state/2 ). It's possible to change how this status is represented by defining the optional GenServer.format_status/2 callback. :sys.trace/3 - prints all the system events to :stdio . :sys.statistics/3 - manages collection of process statistics. :sys.no_debug/2 - turns off all debug handlers for the given process. It is very important to switch off debugging once we're done.

GenServer - Elixir's Getting Started Guide :gen_server module documentation gen_server Behaviour - OTP Design Principles Clients and Servers - Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!","ref":"GenServer.html","source_doc":"A behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation.\n\nA GenServer is a process like any other Elixir process and it can be used\nto keep state, execute code asynchronously and so on. The advantage of using\na generic server process (GenServer) implemented using this module is that it\nwill have a standard set of interface functions and include functionality for\ntracing and error reporting. It will also fit into a supervision tree.\n\n## Example\n\nThe GenServer behaviour abstracts the common client-server interaction.\nDevelopers are only required to implement the callbacks and functionality\nthey are interested in.\n\nLet's start with a code example and then explore the available callbacks.\nImagine we want to implement a service with a GenServer that works\nlike a stack, allowing us to push and pop elements. We'll customize a\ngeneric GenServer with our own module by implementing three callbacks.\n\n`c:init/1` transforms our initial argument to the initial state for the\nGenServer. `c:handle_call/3` fires when the server receives a synchronous\n`pop` message, popping an element from the stack and returning it to the\nuser. `c:handle_cast/2` will fire when the server receives an asynchronous\n`push` message, pushing an element onto the stack:\n\n    defmodule Stack do\n      use GenServer\n\n      # Callbacks\n\n      @impl true\n      def init(elements) do\n        initial_state = String.split(elements, \",\", trim: true)\n        {:ok, initial_state}\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def handle_call(:pop, _from, state) do\n        [to_caller | new_state] = state\n        {:reply, to_caller, new_state}\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def handle_cast({:push, element}, state) do\n        new_state = [element | state]\n        {:noreply, new_state}\n      end\n    end\n\nWe leave the process machinery of startup, message passing, and the message\nloop to the GenServer behaviour and focus only on the stack\nimplementation. We can now use the GenServer API to interact with\nthe service by creating a process and sending it messages:\n\n    # Start the server\n    {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, \"hello,world\")\n\n    # This is the client\n    GenServer.call(pid, :pop)\n    #=> \"hello\"\n\n    GenServer.cast(pid, {:push, \"elixir\"})\n    #=> :ok\n\n    GenServer.call(pid, :pop)\n    #=> \"elixir\"\n\nWe start our `Stack` by calling `start_link/2`, passing the module\nwith the server implementation and its initial argument with a\ncomma-separated list of elements. The GenServer behaviour calls the\n`c:init/1` callback to establish the initial GenServer state. From\nthis point on, the GenServer has control so we interact with it by\nsending two types of messages on the client. **call** messages expect\na reply from the server (and are therefore synchronous) while **cast**\nmessages do not.\n\nEach call to `GenServer.call/3` results in a message\nthat must be handled by the `c:handle_call/3` callback in the GenServer.\nA `cast/2` message must be handled by `c:handle_cast/2`. `GenServer`\nsupports 8 callbacks, but only `c:init/1` is required.\n\n## Client / Server APIs\n\nAlthough in the example above we have used `GenServer.start_link/3` and\nfriends to directly start and communicate with the server, most of the\ntime we don't call the `GenServer` functions directly. Instead, we wrap\nthe calls in new functions representing the public API of the server.\nThese thin wrappers are called the **client API**.\n\nHere is a better implementation of our Stack module:\n\n    defmodule Stack do\n      use GenServer\n\n      # Client\n\n      def start_link(default) when is_binary(default) do\n        GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, default)\n      end\n\n      def push(pid, element) do\n        GenServer.cast(pid, {:push, element})\n      end\n\n      def pop(pid) do\n        GenServer.call(pid, :pop)\n      end\n\n      # Server (callbacks)\n\n      @impl true\n      def init(elements) do\n        initial_state = String.split(elements, \",\", trim: true)\n        {:ok, initial_state}\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def handle_call(:pop, _from, state) do\n        [to_caller | new_state] = state\n        {:reply, to_caller, new_state}\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def handle_cast({:push, element}, state) do\n        new_state = [element | state]\n        {:noreply, new_state}\n      end\n    end\n\n\nIn practice, it is common to have both server and client functions in\nthe same module. If the server and/or client implementations are growing\ncomplex, you may want to have them in different modules.\n\n## How to supervise\n\nA `GenServer` is most commonly started under a supervision tree.\nWhen we invoke `use GenServer`, it automatically defines a `child_spec/1`\nfunction that allows us to start the `Stack` directly under a supervisor.\nTo start a default stack of `[\"hello\", \"world\"]` under a supervisor,\nwe can do:\n\n    children = [\n      {Stack, \"hello,world\"}\n    ]\n\n    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_all)\n\nNote that specifying a module `MyServer` would be the same as specifying\nthe  tuple `{MyServer, []}`.\n\n`use GenServer` also accepts a list of options which configures the\nchild specification and therefore how it runs under a supervisor.\nThe generated `child_spec/1` can be customized with the following options:\n\n  * `:id` - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module\n  * `:restart` - when the child should be restarted, defaults to `:permanent`\n  * `:shutdown` - how to shut down the child, either immediately or by giving it time to shut down\n\nFor example:\n\n    use GenServer, restart: :transient, shutdown: 10_000\n\nSee the \"Child specification\" section in the `Supervisor` module for more\ndetailed information. The `@doc` annotation immediately preceding\n`use GenServer` will be attached to the generated `child_spec/1` function.\n\nWhen stopping the GenServer, for example by returning a `{:stop, reason, new_state}`\ntuple from a callback, the exit reason is used by the supervisor to determine\nwhether the GenServer needs to be restarted. See the \"Exit reasons and restarts\"\nsection in the `Supervisor` module.\n\n## Name registration\n\nBoth `start_link/3` and `start/3` support the `GenServer` to register\na name on start via the `:name` option. Registered names are also\nautomatically cleaned up on termination. The supported values are:\n\n  * an atom - the GenServer is registered locally (to the current node)\n    with the given name using `Process.register/2`.\n\n  * `{:global, term}` - the GenServer is registered globally with the given\n    term using the functions in the [`:global` module](`:global`).\n\n  * `{:via, module, term}` - the GenServer is registered with the given\n    mechanism and name. The `:via` option expects a module that exports\n    `register_name/2`, `unregister_name/1`, `whereis_name/1` and `send/2`.\n    One such example is the [`:global` module](`:global`) which uses these functions\n    for keeping the list of names of processes and their associated PIDs\n    that are available globally for a network of Elixir nodes. Elixir also\n    ships with a local, decentralized and scalable registry called `Registry`\n    for locally storing names that are generated dynamically.\n\nFor example, we could start and register our `Stack` server locally as follows:\n\n    # Start the server and register it locally with name MyStack\n    {:ok, _} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, \"hello\", name: MyStack)\n\n    # Now messages can be sent directly to MyStack\n    GenServer.call(MyStack, :pop)\n    #=> \"hello\"\n\nOnce the server is started, the remaining functions in this module (`call/3`,\n`cast/2`, and friends) will also accept an atom, or any `{:global, ...}` or\n`{:via, ...}` tuples. In general, the following formats are supported:\n\n  * a PID\n  * an atom if the server is locally registered\n  * `{atom, node}` if the server is locally registered at another node\n  * `{:global, term}` if the server is globally registered\n  * `{:via, module, name}` if the server is registered through an alternative\n    registry\n\nIf there is an interest to register dynamic names locally, do not use\natoms, as atoms are never garbage-collected and therefore dynamically\ngenerated atoms won't be garbage-collected. For such cases, you can\nset up your own local registry by using the `Registry` module.\n\n## Receiving \"regular\" messages\n\nThe goal of a `GenServer` is to abstract the \"receive\" loop for developers,\nautomatically handling system messages, supporting code change, synchronous\ncalls and more. Therefore, you should never call your own \"receive\" inside\nthe GenServer callbacks as doing so will cause the GenServer to misbehave.\n\nBesides the synchronous and asynchronous communication provided by `call/3`\nand `cast/2`, \"regular\" messages sent by functions such as `send/2`,\n`Process.send_after/4` and similar, can be handled inside the `c:handle_info/2`\ncallback.\n\n`c:handle_info/2` can be used in many situations, such as handling monitor\nDOWN messages sent by `Process.monitor/1`. Another use case for `c:handle_info/2`\nis to perform periodic work, with the help of `Process.send_after/4`:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.Periodically do\n      use GenServer\n\n      def start_link(_) do\n        GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{})\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def init(state) do\n        # Schedule work to be performed on start\n        schedule_work()\n\n        {:ok, state}\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def handle_info(:work, state) do\n        # Do the desired work here\n        # ...\n\n        # Reschedule once more\n        schedule_work()\n\n        {:noreply, state}\n      end\n\n      defp schedule_work do\n        # We schedule the work to happen in 2 hours (written in milliseconds).\n        # Alternatively, one might write :timer.hours(2)\n        Process.send_after(self(), :work, 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n      end\n    end\n\n## Timeouts\n\nThe return value of `c:init/1` or any of the `handle_*` callbacks may include\na timeout value in milliseconds; if not, `:infinity` is assumed.\nThe timeout can be used to detect a lull in incoming messages.\n\nThe `timeout()` value is used as follows:\n\n  * If the process has any message already waiting when the `timeout()` value\n    is returned, the timeout is ignored and the waiting message is handled as\n    usual. This means that even a timeout of `0` milliseconds is not guaranteed\n    to execute (if you want to take another action immediately and unconditionally,\n    use a `:continue` instruction instead).\n\n  * If any message arrives before the specified number of milliseconds\n    elapse, the timeout is cleared and that message is handled as usual.\n\n  * Otherwise, when the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed with no\n    message arriving, `handle_info/2` is called with `:timeout` as the first\n    argument.\n\n## When (not) to use a GenServer\n\nSo far, we have learned that a `GenServer` can be used as a supervised process\nthat handles sync and async calls. It can also handle system messages, such as\nperiodic messages and monitoring events. GenServer processes may also be named.\n\nA GenServer, or a process in general, must be used to model runtime characteristics\nof your system. A GenServer must never be used for code organization purposes.\n\nIn Elixir, code organization is done by modules and functions, processes are not\nnecessary. For example, imagine you are implementing a calculator and you decide\nto put all the calculator operations behind a GenServer:\n\n    def add(a, b) do\n      GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:add, a, b})\n    end\n\n    def subtract(a, b) do\n      GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:subtract, a, b})\n    end\n\n    def handle_call({:add, a, b}, _from, state) do\n      {:reply, a + b, state}\n    end\n\n    def handle_call({:subtract, a, b}, _from, state) do\n      {:reply, a - b, state}\n    end\n\nThis is an anti-pattern not only because it convolutes the calculator logic but\nalso because you put the calculator logic behind a single process that will\npotentially become a bottleneck in your system, especially as the number of\ncalls grow. Instead just define the functions directly:\n\n    def add(a, b) do\n      a + b\n    end\n\n    def subtract(a, b) do\n      a - b\n    end\n\nIf you don't need a process, then you don't need a process. Use processes only to\nmodel runtime properties, such as mutable state, concurrency and failures, never\nfor code organization.\n\n## Debugging with the :sys module\n\nGenServers, as [special processes](https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/spec_proc.html),\ncan be debugged using the [`:sys` module](`:sys`).\nThrough various hooks, this module allows developers to introspect the state of\nthe process and trace system events that happen during its execution, such as\nreceived messages, sent replies and state changes.\n\nLet's explore the basic functions from the\n[`:sys` module](`:sys`) used for debugging:\n\n  * `:sys.get_state/2` - allows retrieval of the state of the process.\n    In the case of a GenServer process, it will be the callback module state,\n    as passed into the callback functions as last argument.\n  * `:sys.get_status/2` - allows retrieval of the status of the process.\n    This status includes the process dictionary, if the process is running\n    or is suspended, the parent PID, the debugger state, and the state of\n    the behaviour module, which includes the callback module state\n    (as returned by `:sys.get_state/2`). It's possible to change how this\n    status is represented by defining the optional `c:GenServer.format_status/2`\n    callback.\n  * `:sys.trace/3` - prints all the system events to `:stdio`.\n  * `:sys.statistics/3` - manages collection of process statistics.\n  * `:sys.no_debug/2` - turns off all debug handlers for the given process.\n    It is very important to switch off debugging once we're done. Excessive\n    debug handlers or those that should be turned off, but weren't, can\n    seriously damage the performance of the system.\n  * `:sys.suspend/2` - allows to suspend a process so that it only\n    replies to system messages but no other messages. A suspended process\n    can be reactivated via `:sys.resume/2`.\n\nLet's see how we could use those functions for debugging the stack server\nwe defined earlier.\n\n    iex> {:ok, pid} = Stack.start_link([])\n    iex> :sys.statistics(pid, true) # turn on collecting process statistics\n    iex> :sys.trace(pid, true) # turn on event printing\n    iex> Stack.push(pid, 1)\n    *DBG* <0.122.0> got cast {push,1}\n    *DBG* <0.122.0> new state [1]\n    :ok\n\n    iex> :sys.get_state(pid)\n    [1]\n\n    iex> Stack.pop(pid)\n    *DBG* <0.122.0> got call pop from <0.80.0>\n    *DBG* <0.122.0> sent 1 to <0.80.0>, new state []\n    1\n\n    iex> :sys.statistics(pid, :get)\n    {:ok,\n     [\n       start_time: {{2016, 7, 16}, {12, 29, 41}},\n       current_time: {{2016, 7, 16}, {12, 29, 50}},\n       reductions: 117,\n       messages_in: 2,\n       messages_out: 0\n     ]}\n\n    iex> :sys.no_debug(pid) # turn off all debug handlers\n    :ok\n\n    iex> :sys.get_status(pid)\n    {:status, #PID<0.122.0>, {:module, :gen_server},\n     [\n       [\n         \"$initial_call\": {Stack, :init, 1},            # process dictionary\n         \"$ancestors\": [#PID<0.80.0>, #PID<0.51.0>]\n       ],\n       :running,                                        # :running | :suspended\n       #PID<0.80.0>,                                    # parent\n       [],                                              # debugger state\n       [\n         header: 'Status for generic server <0.122.0>', # module status\n         data: [\n           {'Status', :running},\n           {'Parent', #PID<0.80.0>},\n           {'Logged events', []}\n         ],\n         data: [{'State', [1]}]\n       ]\n     ]}\n\n## Learn more\n\nIf you wish to find out more about GenServers, the Elixir Getting Started\nguide provides a tutorial-like introduction.

Certain processes may become bottlenecks in large systems. If those processes can have their state trivially partitioned, in a way there is no dependency between them, then they can use the PartitionSupervisor to create multiple isolated and independent partitions. Once the PartitionSupervisor starts, you can dispatch to its children using {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}} , where name is the name of the PartitionSupervisor and key is used for routing. Simple Example Let's start with an example which is not useful per se, but shows how the partitions are started and how messages are routed to them. Here's a toy GenServer that simply collects the messages it's given. It prints them for easy illustration. defmodule Collector do use GenServer def start_link ( args ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , args ) end def init ( args ) do IO . inspect [ __MODULE__ , &quot; got args &quot; , args , &quot; in &quot; , self ( ) ] { :ok , _initial_state = [ ] } end def collect ( server , msg ) do GenServer . call ( server , { :collect , msg } ) end def handle_call ( { :collect , msg } , _from , state ) do new_state = [ msg | state ] IO . inspect [ &quot;current messages:&quot; , new_state , &quot; in process&quot; , self ( ) ] { :reply , :ok , new_state } end end To run multiple of these, we can start them under a PartitionSupervisor by placing this in our supervision tree: { PartitionSupervisor , child_spec : Collector . child_spec ( [ some : :arg ] ) , name : MyApp.PartitionSupervisor } We can send messages to them using a &quot;via tuple&quot;: # The key is used to route our message to a particular instance. key = 1 Collector . collect ( { :via , PartitionSupervisor , { MyApp.PartitionSupervisor , key } } , :hi ) # [&quot;current messages:&quot;, [:hi], &quot; in process&quot;, #PID&lt;0.602.0&gt;] :ok Collector . collect ( { :via , PartitionSupervisor , { MyApp.PartitionSupervisor , key } } , :ho ) # [&quot;current messages:&quot;, [:ho, :hi], &quot; in process&quot;, #PID&lt;0.602.0&gt;] :ok # With a different key, the message will be routed to a different instance. key = 2 Collector . collect ( { :via , PartitionSupervisor , { MyApp.PartitionSupervisor , key } } , :a ) # [&quot;current messages:&quot;, [:a], &quot; in process&quot;, #PID&lt;0.603.0&gt;] :ok Collector . collect ( { :via , PartitionSupervisor , { MyApp.PartitionSupervisor , key } } , :b ) # [&quot;current messages:&quot;, [:b, :a], &quot; in process&quot;, #PID&lt;0.603.0&gt;] :ok Now let's move on to a useful example. DynamicSupervisor Example The DynamicSupervisor is a single process responsible for starting other processes. In some applications, the DynamicSupervisor may become a bottleneck. To address this, you can start multiple instances of the DynamicSupervisor through a PartitionSupervisor , and then pick a &quot;random&quot; instance to start the child on. Instead of starting a single DynamicSupervisor : children = [ { DynamicSupervisor , name : MyApp.DynamicSupervisor } ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) and starting children on that dynamic supervisor directly: DynamicSupervisor . start_child ( MyApp.DynamicSupervisor , { Agent , fn -&gt; %{ } end } ) You can do start the dynamic supervisors under a PartitionSupervisor : children = [ { PartitionSupervisor , child_spec : DynamicSupervisor , name : MyApp.DynamicSupervisors } ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) and then: DynamicSupervisor . start_child ( { :via , PartitionSupervisor , { MyApp.DynamicSupervisors , self ( ) } } , { Agent , fn -&gt; %{ } end } ) In the code above, we start a partition supervisor that will by default start a dynamic supervisor for each core in your machine. Then, instead of calling the DynamicSupervisor by name, you call it through the partition supervisor using the {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}} format. We picked self() as the routing key, which means each process will be assigned one of the existing dynamic supervisors. See start_link/1 to see all options supported by the PartitionSupervisor . Implementation notes The PartitionSupervisor uses either an ETS table or a Registry to manage all of the partitions. Under the hood, the PartitionSupervisor generates a child spec for each partition and then acts as a regular supervisor. The ID of each child spec is the partition number. For routing, two strategies are used. If key is an integer, it is routed using rem(abs(key), partitions) where partitions is the number of partitions. Otherwise it uses :erlang.phash2(key, partitions) . The particular routing may change in the future, and therefore must not be relied on. If you want to retrieve a particular PID for a certain key, you can use GenServer.whereis({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}}) .","ref":"PartitionSupervisor.html","source_doc":"A supervisor that starts multiple partitions of the same child.\n\nCertain processes may become bottlenecks in large systems.\nIf those processes can have their state trivially partitioned,\nin a way there is no dependency between them, then they can use\nthe `PartitionSupervisor` to create multiple isolated and\nindependent partitions.\n\nOnce the `PartitionSupervisor` starts, you can dispatch to its\nchildren using `{:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}}`, where\n`name` is the name of the `PartitionSupervisor` and key is used\nfor routing.\n\n## Simple Example\n\nLet's start with an example which is not useful per se, but shows how the\npartitions are started and how messages are routed to them.\n\nHere's a toy GenServer that simply collects the messages it's given.\nIt prints them for easy illustration.\n\n    defmodule Collector do\n      use GenServer\n\n      def start_link(args) do\n        GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, args)\n      end\n\n      def init(args) do\n        IO.inspect [__MODULE__, \" got args \", args, \" in \", self()]\n        {:ok, _initial_state = []}\n      end\n\n      def collect(server, msg) do\n        GenServer.call(server, {:collect, msg})\n      end\n\n      def handle_call({:collect, msg}, _from, state) do\n        new_state = [msg | state]\n        IO.inspect [\"current messages:\", new_state, \" in process\", self()]\n        {:reply, :ok, new_state}\n      end\n    end\n\nTo run multiple of these, we can start them under a `PartitionSupervisor` by placing\nthis in our supervision tree:\n\n    {PartitionSupervisor,\n      child_spec: Collector.child_spec([some: :arg]),\n      name: MyApp.PartitionSupervisor\n    }\n\nWe can send messages to them using a \"via tuple\":\n\n    # The key is used to route our message to a particular instance.\n    key = 1\n    Collector.collect({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.PartitionSupervisor, key}}, :hi)\n    # [\"current messages:\", [:hi], \" in process\", #PID<0.602.0>]\n    :ok\n    Collector.collect({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.PartitionSupervisor, key}}, :ho)\n    # [\"current messages:\", [:ho, :hi], \" in process\", #PID<0.602.0>]\n    :ok\n\n    # With a different key, the message will be routed to a different instance.\n    key = 2\n    Collector.collect({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.PartitionSupervisor, key}}, :a)\n    # [\"current messages:\", [:a], \" in process\", #PID<0.603.0>]\n    :ok\n    Collector.collect({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.PartitionSupervisor, key}}, :b)\n    # [\"current messages:\", [:b, :a], \" in process\", #PID<0.603.0>]\n    :ok\n\nNow let's move on to a useful example.\n\n## `DynamicSupervisor` Example\n\nThe `DynamicSupervisor` is a single process responsible for starting\nother processes.

It allows developers to lookup one or more processes with a given key. If the registry has :unique keys, a key points to 0 or 1 process. If the registry allows :duplicate keys, a single key may point to any number of processes. In both cases, different keys could identify the same process. Each entry in the registry is associated to the process that has registered the key. If the process crashes, the keys associated to that process are automatically removed. All key comparisons in the registry are done using the match operation ( ===/2 ). The registry can be used for different purposes, such as name lookups (using the :via option), storing properties, custom dispatching rules, or a pubsub implementation. We explore some of those use cases below. The registry may also be transparently partitioned, which provides more scalable behaviour for running registries on highly concurrent environments with thousands or millions of entries. Using in :via Once the registry is started with a given name using Registry.start_link/1 , it can be used to register and access named processes using the {:via, Registry, {registry, key}} tuple: { :ok , _ } = Registry . start_link ( keys : :unique , name : Registry.ViaTest ) name = { :via , Registry , { Registry.ViaTest , &quot;agent&quot; } } { :ok , _ } = Agent . start_link ( fn -&gt; 0 end , name : name ) Agent . get ( name , &amp; &amp;1 ) #=&gt; 0 Agent . update ( name , &amp; ( &amp;1 + 1 ) ) Agent . get ( name , &amp; &amp;1 ) #=&gt; 1 In the previous example, we were not interested in associating a value to the process: Registry . lookup ( Registry.ViaTest , &quot;agent&quot; ) #=&gt; [{self(), nil}] However, in some cases it may be desired to associate a value to the process using the alternate {:via, Registry, {registry, key, value}} tuple: { :ok , _ } = Registry . start_link ( keys : :unique , name : Registry.ViaTest ) name = { :via , Registry , { Registry.ViaTest , &quot;agent&quot; , :hello } } { :ok , agent_pid } = Agent . start_link ( fn -&gt; 0 end , name : name ) Registry . lookup ( Registry.ViaTest , &quot;agent&quot; ) #=&gt; [{agent_pid, :hello}] To this point, we have been starting Registry using start_link/1 . Typically the registry is started as part of a supervision tree though: { Registry , keys : :unique , name : Registry.ViaTest } Only registries with unique keys can be used in :via . If the name is already taken, the case-specific start_link function ( Agent.start_link/2 in the example above) will return {:error, {:already_started, current_pid}} . Using as a dispatcher Registry has a dispatch mechanism that allows developers to implement custom dispatch logic triggered from the caller. For example, let's say we have a duplicate registry started as so: { :ok , _ } = Registry . start_link ( keys : :duplicate , name : Registry.DispatcherTest ) By calling register/3 , different processes can register under a given key and associate any value under that key. In this case, let's register the current process under the key &quot;hello&quot; and attach the {IO, :inspect} tuple to it: { :ok , _ } = Registry . register ( Registry.DispatcherTest , &quot;hello&quot; , { IO , :inspect } ) Now, an entity interested in dispatching events for a given key may call dispatch/3 passing in the key and a callback. This callback will be invoked with a list of all the values registered under the requested key, alongside the PID of the process that registered each value, in the form of {pid, value} tuples. In our example, value will be the {module, function} tuple in the code above: Registry . dispatch ( Registry.DispatcherTest , &quot;hello&quot; , fn entries -&gt; for { pid , { module , function } } &lt;- entries , do : apply ( module , function , [ pid ] ) end ) # Prints #PID&lt;...&gt; where the PID is for the process that called register/3 above #=&gt; :ok Dispatching happens in the process that calls dispatch/3 either serially or concurrently in case of multiple partitions (via spawned tasks). The registered processes are not involved in dispatching unless involving them is done explicitly (for example, by sending them a message in the callback). Furthermore, if there is a failure when dispatching, due to a bad registration, dispatching will always fail and the registered process will not be notified. Therefore let's make sure we at least wrap and report those errors: require Logger Registry . dispatch ( Registry.DispatcherTest , &quot;hello&quot; , fn entries -&gt; for { pid , { module , function } } &lt;- entries do try do apply ( module , function , [ pid ] ) catch kind , reason -&gt; formatted = Exception . format ( kind , reason , __STACKTRACE__ ) Logger . error ( &quot;Registry.dispatch/3 failed with \#{ formatted } &quot; ) end end end ) # Prints #PID&lt;...&gt; #=&gt; :ok You could also replace the whole apply system by explicitly sending messages. That's the example we will see next. Using as a PubSub Registries can also be used to implement a local, non-distributed, scalable PubSub by relying on the dispatch/3 function, similarly to the previous section: in this case, however, we will send messages to each associated process, instead of invoking a given module-function. In this example, we will also set the number of partitions to the number of schedulers online, which will make the registry more performant on highly concurrent environments: { :ok , _ } = Registry . start_link ( keys : :duplicate , name : Registry.PubSubTest , partitions : System . schedulers_online ( ) ) { :ok , _ } = Registry . register ( Registry.PubSubTest , &quot;hello&quot; , [ ] ) Registry . dispatch ( Registry.PubSubTest , &quot;hello&quot; , fn entries -&gt; for { pid , _ } &lt;- entries , do : send ( pid , { :broadcast , &quot;world&quot; } ) end ) #=&gt; :ok The example above broadcasted the message {:broadcast, &quot;world&quot;} to all processes registered under the &quot;topic&quot; (or &quot;key&quot; as we called it until now) &quot;hello&quot; . The third argument given to register/3 is a value associated to the current process. While in the previous section we used it when dispatching, in this particular example we are not interested in it, so we have set it to an empty list. You could store a more meaningful value if necessary. Registrations Looking up, dispatching and registering are efficient and immediate at the cost of delayed unsubscription. For example, if a process crashes, its keys are automatically removed from the registry but the change may not propagate immediately. This means certain operations may return processes that are already dead. When such may happen, it will be explicitly stated in the function documentation. However, keep in mind those cases are typically not an issue. After all, a process referenced by a PID may crash at any time, including between getting the value from the registry and sending it a message. Many parts of the standard library are designed to cope with that, such as Process.monitor/1 which will deliver the :DOWN message immediately if the monitored process is already dead and send/2 which acts as a no-op for dead processes. ETS Note that the registry uses one ETS table plus two ETS tables per partition.","ref":"Registry.html","source_doc":"A local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage.\n\nIt allows developers to lookup one or more processes with a given key.\nIf the registry has `:unique` keys, a key points to 0 or 1 process.\nIf the registry allows `:duplicate` keys, a single key may point to any\nnumber of processes. In both cases, different keys could identify the\nsame process.\n\nEach entry in the registry is associated to the process that has\nregistered the key. If the process crashes, the keys associated to that\nprocess are automatically removed. All key comparisons in the registry\nare done using the match operation (`===/2`).\n\nThe registry can be used for different purposes, such as name lookups (using\nthe `:via` option), storing properties, custom dispatching rules, or a pubsub\nimplementation. We explore some of those use cases below.\n\nThe registry may also be transparently partitioned, which provides\nmore scalable behaviour for running registries on highly concurrent\nenvironments with thousands or millions of entries.\n\n## Using in `:via`\n\nOnce the registry is started with a given name using\n`Registry.start_link/1`, it can be used to register and access named\nprocesses using the `{:via, Registry, {registry, key}}` tuple:\n\n    {:ok, _} = Registry.start_link(keys: :unique, name: Registry.ViaTest)\n    name = {:via, Registry, {Registry.ViaTest, \"agent\"}}\n    {:ok, _} = Agent.start_link(fn -> 0 end, name: name)\n    Agent.get(name, & &1)\n    #=> 0\n    Agent.update(name, &(&1 + 1))\n    Agent.get(name, & &1)\n    #=> 1\n\nIn the previous example, we were not interested in associating a value to the\nprocess:\n\n    Registry.lookup(Registry.ViaTest, \"agent\")\n    #=> [{self(), nil}]\n\nHowever, in some cases it may be desired to associate a value to the process\nusing the alternate `{:via, Registry, {registry, key, value}}` tuple:\n\n    {:ok, _} = Registry.start_link(keys: :unique, name: Registry.ViaTest)\n    name = {:via, Registry, {Registry.ViaTest, \"agent\", :hello}}\n    {:ok, agent_pid} = Agent.start_link(fn -> 0 end, name: name)\n    Registry.lookup(Registry.ViaTest, \"agent\")\n    #=> [{agent_pid, :hello}]\n\nTo this point, we have been starting `Registry` using `start_link/1`.\nTypically the registry is started as part of a supervision tree though:\n\n    {Registry, keys: :unique, name: Registry.ViaTest}\n\nOnly registries with unique keys can be used in `:via`. If the name is\nalready taken, the case-specific `start_link` function (`Agent.start_link/2`\nin the example above) will return `{:error, {:already_started, current_pid}}`.\n\n## Using as a dispatcher\n\n`Registry` has a dispatch mechanism that allows developers to implement custom\ndispatch logic triggered from the caller. For example, let's say we have a\nduplicate registry started as so:\n\n    {:ok, _} = Registry.start_link(keys: :duplicate, name: Registry.DispatcherTest)\n\nBy calling `register/3`, different processes can register under a given key\nand associate any value under that key. In this case, let's register the\ncurrent process under the key `\"hello\"` and attach the `{IO, :inspect}` tuple\nto it:\n\n    {:ok, _} = Registry.register(Registry.DispatcherTest, \"hello\", {IO, :inspect})\n\nNow, an entity interested in dispatching events for a given key may call\n`dispatch/3` passing in the key and a callback. This callback will be invoked\nwith a list of all the values registered under the requested key, alongside\nthe PID of the process that registered each value, in the form of `{pid,\nvalue}` tuples. In our example, `value` will be the `{module, function}` tuple\nin the code above:\n\n    Registry.dispatch(Registry.DispatcherTest, \"hello\", fn entries ->\n      for {pid, {module, function}} <- entries, do: apply(module, function, [pid])\n    end)\n    # Prints #PID<...> where the PID is for the process that called register/3 above\n    #=> :ok\n\nDispatching happens in the process that calls `dispatch/3` either serially or\nconcurrently in case of multiple partitions (via spawned tasks). The\nregistered processes are not involved in dispatching unless involving them is\ndone explicitly (for example, by sending them a message in the callback).\n\nFurthermore, if there is a failure when dispatching, due to a bad\nregistration, dispatching will always fail and the registered process will not\nbe notified. Therefore let's make sure we at least wrap and report those\nerrors:\n\n    require Logger\n\n    Registry.dispatch(Registry.DispatcherTest, \"hello\", fn entries ->\n      for {pid, {module, function}} <- entries do\n        try do\n          apply(module, function, [pid])\n        catch\n          kind, reason ->\n            formatted = Exception.format(kind, reason, __STACKTRACE__)\n            Logger.error(\"Registry.dispatch/3 failed with \#{formatted}\")\n        end\n      end\n    end)\n    # Prints #PID<...>\n    #=> :ok\n\nYou could also replace the whole `apply` system by explicitly sending\nmessages. That's the example we will see next.\n\n## Using as a PubSub\n\nRegistries can also be used to implement a local, non-distributed, scalable\nPubSub by relying on the `dispatch/3` function, similarly to the previous\nsection: in this case, however, we will send messages to each associated\nprocess, instead of invoking a given module-function.\n\nIn this example, we will also set the number of partitions to the number of\nschedulers online, which will make the registry more performant on highly\nconcurrent environments:\n\n    {:ok, _} =\n      Registry.start_link(\n        keys: :duplicate,\n        name: Registry.PubSubTest,\n        partitions: System.schedulers_online()\n      )\n\n    {:ok, _} = Registry.register(Registry.PubSubTest, \"hello\", [])\n\n    Registry.dispatch(Registry.PubSubTest, \"hello\", fn entries ->\n      for {pid, _} <- entries, do: send(pid, {:broadcast, \"world\"})\n    end)\n    #=> :ok\n\nThe example above broadcasted the message `{:broadcast, \"world\"}` to all\nprocesses registered under the \"topic\" (or \"key\" as we called it until now)\n`\"hello\"`.\n\nThe third argument given to `register/3` is a value associated to the\ncurrent process. While in the previous section we used it when dispatching,\nin this particular example we are not interested in it, so we have set it\nto an empty list. You could store a more meaningful value if necessary.\n\n## Registrations\n\nLooking up, dispatching and registering are efficient and immediate at\nthe cost of delayed unsubscription. For example, if a process crashes,\nits keys are automatically removed from the registry but the change may\nnot propagate immediately. This means certain operations may return processes\nthat are already dead. When such may happen, it will be explicitly stated\nin the function documentation.\n\nHowever, keep in mind those cases are typically not an issue. After all, a\nprocess referenced by a PID may crash at any time, including between getting\nthe value from the registry and sending it a message. Many parts of the standard\nlibrary are designed to cope with that, such as `Process.monitor/1` which will\ndeliver the `:DOWN` message immediately if the monitored process is already dead\nand `send/2` which acts as a no-op for dead processes.\n\n## ETS\n\nNote that the registry uses one ETS table plus two ETS tables per partition.\n","title":"Registry","type":"module"},{"doc":"Returns a specification to start a registry under a supervisor.

A supervisor is a process which supervises other processes, which we refer to as child processes . Supervisors are used to build a hierarchical process structure called a supervision tree . Supervision trees provide fault-tolerance and encapsulate how our applications start and shutdown. A supervisor may be started directly with a list of child specifications via start_link/2 or you may define a module-based supervisor that implements the required callbacks. The sections below use start_link/2 to start supervisors in most examples, but it also includes a specific section on module-based ones. Examples In order to start a supervisor, we need to first define a child process that will be supervised. As an example, we will define a GenServer , a generic server, that keeps a counter. Other processes can then send messages to this process to read the counter and bump its value. Disclaimer In practice you would not define a counter as a GenServer. Instead, if you need a counter, you would pass it around as inputs and outputs to the functions that need it. The reason we picked a counter in this example is due to its simplicity, as it allows us to focus on how supervisors work. defmodule Counter do use GenServer def start_link ( arg ) when is_integer ( arg ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , arg , name : __MODULE__ ) end ## Callbacks @impl true def init ( counter ) do { :ok , counter } end @impl true def handle_call ( :get , _from , counter ) do { :reply , counter , counter } end def handle_call ( { :bump , value } , _from , counter ) do { :reply , counter , counter + value } end end The Counter receives an argument on start_link . This argument is passed to the init/1 callback which becomes the initial value of the counter. Our counter handles two operations (known as calls): :get , to get the current counter value, and :bump , that bumps the counter by the given value and returns the old counter. We can now start a supervisor that will start and supervise our counter process. The first step is to define a list of child specifications that control how each child behaves. Each child specification is a map, as shown below: children = [ # The Counter is a child started via Counter.start_link(0) %{ id : Counter , start : { Counter , :start_link , [ 0 ] } } ] # Now we start the supervisor with the children and a strategy { :ok , pid } = Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) # After started, we can query the supervisor for information Supervisor . count_children ( pid ) #=&gt; %{active: 1, specs: 1, supervisors: 0, workers: 1} Note that when starting the GenServer, we are registering it with name Counter via the name: __MODULE__ option. This allows us to call it directly and get its value: GenServer . call ( Counter , :get ) #=&gt; 0 GenServer . call ( Counter , { :bump , 3 } ) #=&gt; 0 GenServer . call ( Counter , :get ) #=&gt; 3 However, there is a bug in our counter server. If we call :bump with a non-numeric value, it is going to crash: GenServer . call ( Counter , { :bump , &quot;oops&quot; } ) ** (exit) exited in: GenServer.call(Counter, {:bump, &quot;oops&quot;}, 5000) Luckily, since the server is being supervised by a supervisor, the supervisor will automatically start a new one, reset back to its initial value of 0 : GenServer . call ( Counter , :get ) #=&gt; 0 Supervisors support different strategies; in the example above, we have chosen :one_for_one . Furthermore, each supervisor can have many workers and/or supervisors as children, with each one having its own configuration (as outlined in the &quot;Child specification&quot; section). The rest of this document will cover how child processes are specified, how they can be started and stopped, different supervision strategies and more. Child specification The child specification describes how the supervisor starts, shuts down, and restarts child processes. The child specification is a map containing up to 6 elements. The first two keys in the following list are required, and the remaining ones are optional: :id - any term used to identify the child specification internally by the supervisor; defaults to the given module. This key is required. For supervisors, in the case of conflicting :id values, the supervisor will refuse to initialize and require explicit IDs. This is not the case for dynamic supervisors though. :start - a tuple with the module-function-args to be invoked to start the child process. This key is required. :restart - an atom that defines when a terminated child process should be restarted (see the &quot;Restart values&quot; section below). This key is optional and defaults to :permanent . :shutdown - an integer or atom that defines how a child process should be terminated (see the &quot;Shutdown values&quot; section below). This key is optional and defaults to 5_000 if the type is :worker or :infinity if the type is :supervisor . :type - specifies that the child process is a :worker or a :supervisor . This key is optional and defaults to :worker . :modules - a list of modules used by hot code upgrade mechanisms to determine which processes are using certain modules. It is typically set to the callback module of behaviours like GenServer , Supervisor , and such. It is set automatically based on the :start value and it is rarely changed in practice. :significant - a boolean indicating if the child process should be considered significant with regard to automatic shutdown. Only :transient and :temporary child processes can be marked as significant. This key is optional and defaults to false . See section &quot;Automatic shutdown&quot; below for more details. Let's understand what the :shutdown and :restart options control. Shutdown values (:shutdown) The following shutdown values are supported in the :shutdown option: :brutal_kill - the child process is unconditionally and immediately terminated using Process.exit(child, :kill) . any integer &gt;= 0 - the amount of time in milliseconds that the supervisor will wait for its children to terminate after emitting a Process.exit(child, :shutdown) signal. If the child process is not trapping exits, the initial :shutdown signal will terminate the child process immediately. If the child process is trapping exits, it has the given amount of time to terminate. If it doesn't terminate within the specified time, the child process is unconditionally terminated by the supervisor via Process.exit(child, :kill) . :infinity - works as an integer except the supervisor will wait indefinitely for the child to terminate. If the child process is a supervisor, the recommended value is :infinity to give the supervisor and its children enough time to shut down. This option can be used with regular workers but doing so is discouraged and requires extreme care. If not used carefully, the child process will never terminate, preventing your application from terminating as well. Restart values (:restart) The :restart option controls what the supervisor should consider to be a successful termination or not. If the termination is successful, the supervisor won't restart the child. If the child process crashed, the supervisor will start a new one. The following restart values are supported in the :restart option: :permanent - the child process is always restarted. :temporary - the child process is never restarted, regardless of the supervision strategy: any termination (even abnormal) is considered successful. :transient - the child process is restarted only if it terminates abnormally, i.e., with an exit reason other than :normal , :shutdown , or {:shutdown, term} . For a more complete understanding of the exit reasons and their impact, see the &quot;Exit reasons and restarts&quot; section. child_spec/1 function When starting a supervisor, we may pass a list of child specifications. Those specifications are maps that tell how the supervisor should start, stop and restart each of its children: %{ id : Counter , start : { Counter , :start_link , [ 0 ] } } The map above defines a child with :id of Counter that is started by calling Counter.start_link(0) . However, defining the child specification for each child as a map can be quite error prone, as we may change the Counter implementation and forget to update its specification. That's why Elixir allows you to pass a tuple with the module name and the start_link argument instead of the specification: children = [ { Counter , 0 } ] The supervisor will then invoke Counter.child_spec(0) to retrieve a child specification. Now the Counter module is responsible for building its own specification, for example, we could write: def child_spec ( arg ) do %{ id : Counter , start : { Counter , :start_link , [ arg ] } } end Luckily for us, use GenServer already defines a Counter.child_spec/1 exactly like above, so you don't need to write the definition above yourself. If you want to customize the automatically generated child_spec/1 function, you can pass the options directly to use GenServer : use GenServer , restart : :transient Finally, note it is also possible to simply pass the Counter module as a child: children = [ Counter ] When only the module name is given, it is equivalent to {Counter, []} , which in our case would be invalid, which is why we always pass the initial counter explicitly. By replacing the child specification with {Counter, 0} , we keep it encapsulated in the Counter module. We could now share our Counter implementation with other developers and they can add it directly to their supervision tree without worrying about the low-level details of the counter. Overall, a child specification can be one of the following: a map representing the child specification itself - as outlined in the &quot;Child specification&quot; section a tuple with a module as first element and the start argument as second - such as {Counter, 0} . In this case, Counter.child_spec(0) is called to retrieve the child specification a module - such as Counter . In this case, Counter.child_spec([]) would be called, which is invalid for the counter, but it is useful in many other cases, especially when you want to pass a list of options to the child process If you need to convert a {module, arg} tuple or a module child specification to a child specification or modify a child specification itself, you can use the Supervisor.child_spec/2 function. For example, to run the counter with a different :id and a :shutdown value of 10 seconds (10_000 milliseconds): children = [ Supervisor . child_spec ( { Counter , 0 } , id : MyCounter , shutdown : 10_000 ) ] Supervisor strategies and options So far we have started the supervisor passing a single child as a tuple as well as a strategy called :one_for_one : children = [ { Counter , 0 } ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) The first argument given to start_link/2 is a list of child specifications as defined in the &quot;child_spec/1&quot; section above. The second argument is a keyword list of options: :strategy - the supervision strategy option. It can be either :one_for_one , :rest_for_one or :one_for_all . Required. See the &quot;Strategies&quot; section. :max_restarts - the maximum number of restarts allowed in a time frame. Defaults to 3 . :max_seconds - the time frame in which :max_restarts applies. Defaults to 5 . :auto_shutdown - the automatic shutdown option. It can be :never , :any_significant , or :all_significant . Optional. See the &quot;Automatic shutdown&quot; section. :name - a name to register the supervisor process. Supported values are explained in the &quot;Name registration&quot; section in the documentation for GenServer . Optional. Strategies Supervisors support different supervision strategies (through the :strategy option, as seen above): :one_for_one - if a child process terminates, only that process is restarted. :one_for_all - if a child process terminates, all other child processes are terminated and then all child processes (including the terminated one) are restarted. :rest_for_one - if a child process terminates, the terminated child process and the rest of the children started after it, are terminated and restarted. In the above, process termination refers to unsuccessful termination, which is determined by the :restart option. To efficiently supervise children started dynamically, see DynamicSupervisor . Automatic shutdown Supervisors have the ability to automatically shut themselves down when child processes marked as :significant exit. Supervisors support different automatic shutdown options (through the :auto_shutdown option, as seen above): :never - this is the default, automatic shutdown is disabled. :any_significant - if any significant child process exits, the supervisor will automatically shut down its children, then itself. :all_significant - when all significant child processes have exited, the supervisor will automatically shut down its children, then itself. Only :transient and :temporary child processes can be marked as significant, and this configuration affects the behavior. Significant :transient child processes must exit normally for automatic shutdown to be considered, where :temporary child processes may exit for any reason. Name registration A supervisor is bound to the same name registration rules as a GenServer . Read more about these rules in the documentation for GenServer . Module-based supervisors In the example so far, the supervisor was started by passing the supervision structure to start_link/2 . However, supervisors can also be created by explicitly defining a supervision module: defmodule MyApp.Supervisor do # Automatically defines child_spec/1 use Supervisor def start_link ( init_arg ) do Supervisor . start_link ( __MODULE__ , init_arg , name : __MODULE__ ) end @impl true def init ( _init_arg ) do children = [ { Counter , 0 } ] Supervisor . init ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) end end The difference between the two approaches is that a module-based supervisor gives you more direct control over how the supervisor is initialized. Instead of calling Supervisor.start_link/2 with a list of child specifications that are automatically initialized, we manually initialize the children by calling Supervisor.init/2 inside its init/1 callback. Supervisor.init/2 accepts the same :strategy , :max_restarts , and :max_seconds options as start_link/2 . use Supervisor also defines a child_spec/1 function which allows us to run MyApp.Supervisor as a child of another supervisor or at the top of your supervision tree as: children = [ MyApp.Supervisor ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) A general guideline is to use the supervisor without a callback module only at the top of your supervision tree, generally in the Application.start/2 callback. We recommend using module-based supervisors for any other supervisor in your application, so they can run as a child of another supervisor in the tree. The child_spec/1 generated automatically by Supervisor can be customized with the following options: :id - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module :restart - when the supervisor should be restarted, defaults to :permanent The @doc annotation immediately preceding use Supervisor will be attached to the generated child_spec/1 function. Start and shutdown When the supervisor starts, it traverses all child specifications and then starts each child in the order they are defined. This is done by calling the function defined under the :start key in the child specification and typically defaults to start_link/1 . The start_link/1 (or a custom) is then called for each child process. The start_link/1 function must return {:ok, pid} where pid is the process identifier of a new process that is linked to the supervisor. The child process usually starts its work by executing the init/1 callback. Generally speaking, the init callback is where we initialize and configure the child process. The shutdown process happens in reverse order. When a supervisor shuts down, it terminates all children in the opposite order they are listed. The termination happens by sending a shutdown exit signal, via Process.exit(child_pid, :shutdown) , to the child process and then awaiting for a time interval for the child process to terminate. This interval defaults to 5000 milliseconds. If the child process does not terminate in this interval, the supervisor abruptly terminates the child with reason :kill . The shutdown time can be configured in the child specification which is fully detailed in the next section. If the child process is not trapping exits, it will shutdown immediately when it receives the first exit signal. If the child process is trapping exits, then the terminate callback is invoked, and the child process must terminate in a reasonable time interval before being abruptly terminated by the supervisor. In other words, if it is important that a process cleans after itself when your application or the supervision tree is shutting down, then this process must trap exits and its child specification should specify the proper :shutdown value, ensuring it terminates within a reasonable interval. Exit reasons and restarts A supervisor restarts a child process depending on its :restart configuration. For example, when :restart is set to :transient , the supervisor does not restart the child in case it exits with reason :normal , :shutdown or {:shutdown, term} . Those exits also impact logging. By default, behaviours such as GenServers do not emit error logs when the exit reason is :normal , :shutdown or {:shutdown, term} . So one may ask: which exit reason should I choose? There are three options: :normal - in such cases, the exit won't be logged, there is no restart in transient mode, and linked processes do not exit :shutdown or {:shutdown, term} - in such cases, the exit won't be logged, there is no restart in transient mode, and linked processes exit with the same reason unless they're trapping exits any other term - in such cases, the exit will be logged, there are restarts in transient mode, and linked processes exit with the same reason unless they're trapping exits Generally speaking, if you are exiting for expected reasons, you want to use :shutdown or {:shutdown, term} . Note that the supervisor that reaches maximum restart intensity will exit with :shutdown reason. In this case the supervisor will only be restarted if its child specification was defined with the :restart option set to :permanent (the default).","ref":"Supervisor.html","source_doc":"A behaviour module for implementing supervisors.\n\nA supervisor is a process which supervises other processes, which we\nrefer to as *child processes*.

Only `:transient`\n    and `:temporary` child processes can be marked as significant. This key is\n    optional and defaults to `false`. See section \"Automatic shutdown\" below\n    for more details.\n\nLet's understand what the `:shutdown` and `:restart` options control.\n\n### Shutdown values (:shutdown)\n\nThe following shutdown values are supported in the `:shutdown` option:\n\n  * `:brutal_kill` - the child process is unconditionally and immediately\n    terminated using `Process.exit(child, :kill)`.\n\n  * any integer >= 0 - the amount of time in milliseconds that the\n    supervisor will wait for its children to terminate after emitting a\n    `Process.exit(child, :shutdown)` signal. If the child process is\n    not trapping exits, the initial `:shutdown` signal will terminate\n    the child process immediately. If the child process is trapping\n    exits, it has the given amount of time to terminate.\n    If it doesn't terminate within the specified time, the child process\n    is unconditionally terminated by the supervisor via\n    `Process.exit(child, :kill)`.\n\n  * `:infinity` - works as an integer except the supervisor will wait\n    indefinitely for the child to terminate. If the child process is a\n    supervisor, the recommended value is `:infinity` to give the supervisor\n    and its children enough time to shut down. This option can be used with\n    regular workers but doing so is discouraged and requires extreme care.\n    If not used carefully, the child process will never terminate,\n    preventing your application from terminating as well.\n\n### Restart values (:restart)\n\nThe `:restart` option controls what the supervisor should consider to\nbe a successful termination or not. If the termination is successful,\nthe supervisor won't restart the child. If the child process crashed,\nthe supervisor will start a new one.\n\nThe following restart values are supported in the `:restart` option:\n\n  * `:permanent` - the child process is always restarted.\n\n  * `:temporary` - the child process is never restarted, regardless\n    of the supervision strategy: any termination (even abnormal) is\n    considered successful.\n\n  * `:transient` - the child process is restarted only if it\n    terminates abnormally, i.e., with an exit reason other than\n    `:normal`, `:shutdown`, or `{:shutdown, term}`.\n\nFor a more complete understanding of the exit reasons and their\nimpact, see the \"Exit reasons and restarts\" section.\n\n## `child_spec/1` function\n\nWhen starting a supervisor, we may pass a list of child specifications. Those\nspecifications are maps that tell how the supervisor should start, stop and\nrestart each of its children:\n\n    %{\n      id: Counter,\n      start: {Counter, :start_link, [0]}\n    }\n\nThe map above defines a child with `:id` of `Counter` that is started\nby calling `Counter.start_link(0)`.\n\nHowever, defining the child specification for each child as a map can be\nquite error prone, as we may change the `Counter` implementation and forget\nto update its specification. That's why Elixir allows you to pass a tuple with\nthe module name and the `start_link` argument instead of the specification:\n\n    children = [\n      {Counter, 0}\n    ]\n\nThe supervisor will then invoke `Counter.child_spec(0)` to retrieve a child\nspecification. Now the `Counter` module is responsible for building its own\nspecification, for example, we could write:\n\n    def child_spec(arg) do\n      %{\n        id: Counter,\n        start: {Counter, :start_link, [arg]}\n      }\n    end\n\nLuckily for us, `use GenServer` already defines a `Counter.child_spec/1`\nexactly like above, so you don't need to write the definition above yourself.\nIf you want to customize the automatically generated `child_spec/1` function,\nyou can pass the options directly to `use GenServer`:\n\n    use GenServer, restart: :transient\n\nFinally, note it is also possible to simply pass the `Counter` module as\na child:\n\n    children = [\n      Counter\n    ]\n\nWhen only the module name is given, it is equivalent to `{Counter, []}`,\nwhich in our case would be invalid, which is why we always pass the initial\ncounter explicitly.\n\nBy replacing the child specification with `{Counter, 0}`, we keep it\nencapsulated in the `Counter` module. We could now share our\n`Counter` implementation with other developers and they can add it directly\nto their supervision tree without worrying about the low-level details of\nthe counter.\n\nOverall, a child specification can be one of the following:\n\n  * a map representing the child specification itself - as outlined in the\n    \"Child specification\" section\n\n  * a tuple with a module as first element and the start argument as second -\n    such as `{Counter, 0}`. In this case, `Counter.child_spec(0)` is called\n    to retrieve the child specification\n\n  * a module - such as `Counter`. In this case, `Counter.child_spec([])`\n    would be called, which is invalid for the counter, but it is useful in\n    many other cases, especially when you want to pass a list of options\n    to the child process\n\nIf you need to convert a `{module, arg}` tuple or a module child specification to a\n[child specification](`t:child_spec/0`) or modify a child specification itself,\nyou can use the `Supervisor.child_spec/2` function.\nFor example, to run the counter with a different `:id` and a `:shutdown` value of\n10 seconds (10_000 milliseconds):\n\n    children = [\n      Supervisor.child_spec({Counter, 0}, id: MyCounter, shutdown: 10_000)\n    ]\n\n## Supervisor strategies and options\n\nSo far we have started the supervisor passing a single child as a tuple\nas well as a strategy called `:one_for_one`:\n\n    children = [\n      {Counter, 0}\n    ]\n\n    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\n\nThe first argument given to `start_link/2` is a list of child\nspecifications as defined in the \"child_spec/1\" section above.\n\nThe second argument is a keyword list of options:\n\n  * `:strategy` - the supervision strategy option. It can be either\n    `:one_for_one`, `:rest_for_one` or `:one_for_all`. Required.\n    See the \"Strategies\" section.\n\n  * `:max_restarts` - the maximum number of restarts allowed in\n    a time frame. Defaults to `3`.\n\n  * `:max_seconds` - the time frame in which `:max_restarts` applies.\n    Defaults to `5`.\n\n  * `:auto_shutdown` - the automatic shutdown option. It can be\n    `:never`, `:any_significant`, or `:all_significant`. Optional.\n    See the \"Automatic shutdown\" section.\n\n  * `:name` - a name to register the supervisor process. Supported values are\n    explained in the \"Name registration\" section in the documentation for\n    `GenServer`. Optional.\n\n### Strategies\n\nSupervisors support different supervision strategies (through the\n`:strategy` option, as seen above):\n\n  * `:one_for_one` - if a child process terminates, only that\n    process is restarted.\n\n  * `:one_for_all` - if a child process terminates, all other child\n    processes are terminated and then all child processes (including\n    the terminated one) are restarted.\n\n  * `:rest_for_one` - if a child process terminates, the terminated child\n    process and the rest of the children started after it, are terminated and\n    restarted.\n\nIn the above, process termination refers to unsuccessful termination, which\nis determined by the `:restart` option.\n\nTo efficiently supervise children started dynamically, see `DynamicSupervisor`.\n\n### Automatic shutdown\n\nSupervisors have the ability to automatically shut themselves down when child\nprocesses marked as `:significant` exit.\n\nSupervisors support different automatic shutdown options (through\nthe `:auto_shutdown` option, as seen above):\n\n  * `:never` - this is the default, automatic shutdown is disabled.\n\n  * `:any_significant` - if any significant child process exits, the supervisor\n  will automatically shut down its children, then itself.\n\n  * `:all_significant` - when all significant child processes have exited,\n  the supervisor will automatically shut down its children, then itself.\n\nOnly `:transient` and `:temporary` child processes can be marked as significant,\nand this configuration affects the behavior. Significant `:transient` child\nprocesses must exit normally for automatic shutdown to be considered, where\n`:temporary` child processes may exit for any reason.\n\n### Name registration\n\nA supervisor is bound to the same name registration rules as a `GenServer`.\nRead more about these rules in the documentation for `GenServer`.\n\n## Module-based supervisors\n\nIn the example so far, the supervisor was started by passing the supervision\nstructure to `start_link/2`. However, supervisors can also be created by\nexplicitly defining a supervision module:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.Supervisor do\n      # Automatically defines child_spec/1\n      use Supervisor\n\n      def start_link(init_arg) do\n        Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, init_arg, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      @impl true\n      def init(_init_arg) do\n        children = [\n          {Counter, 0}\n        ]\n\n        Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\n      end\n    end\n\nThe difference between the two approaches is that a module-based\nsupervisor gives you more direct control over how the supervisor\nis initialized. Instead of calling `Supervisor.start_link/2` with\na list of child specifications that are automatically initialized, we manually\ninitialize the children by calling `Supervisor.init/2` inside its\n`c:init/1` callback. `Supervisor.init/2` accepts the same `:strategy`,\n`:max_restarts`, and `:max_seconds` options as `start_link/2`.\n\n`use Supervisor` also defines a `child_spec/1` function which allows\nus to run `MyApp.Supervisor` as a child of another supervisor or\nat the top of your supervision tree as:\n\n    children = [\n      MyApp.Supervisor\n    ]\n\n    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\n\nA general guideline is to use the supervisor without a callback\nmodule only at the top of your supervision tree, generally in the\n`c:Application.start/2` callback. We recommend using module-based\nsupervisors for any other supervisor in your application, so they\ncan run as a child of another supervisor in the tree. The `child_spec/1`\ngenerated automatically by `Supervisor` can be customized with the\nfollowing options:\n\n  * `:id` - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module\n  * `:restart` - when the supervisor should be restarted, defaults to `:permanent`\n\nThe `@doc` annotation immediately preceding `use Supervisor` will be\nattached to the generated `child_spec/1` function.\n\n## Start and shutdown\n\nWhen the supervisor starts, it traverses all child specifications and\nthen starts each child in the order they are defined. This is done by\ncalling the function defined under the `:start` key in the child\nspecification and typically defaults to `start_link/1`.\n\nThe `start_link/1` (or a custom) is then called for each child process.\nThe `start_link/1` function must return `{:ok, pid}` where `pid` is the\nprocess identifier of a new process that is linked to the supervisor.\nThe child process usually starts its work by executing the `c:init/1`\ncallback. Generally speaking, the `init` callback is where we initialize\nand configure the child process.\n\nThe shutdown process happens in reverse order.\n\nWhen a supervisor shuts down, it terminates all children in the opposite\norder they are listed. The termination happens by sending a shutdown exit\nsignal, via `Process.exit(child_pid, :shutdown)`, to the child process and\nthen awaiting for a time interval for the child process to terminate. This\ninterval defaults to 5000 milliseconds. If the child process does not\nterminate in this interval, the supervisor abruptly terminates the child\nwith reason `:kill`. The shutdown time can be configured in the child\nspecification which is fully detailed in the next section.\n\nIf the child process is not trapping exits, it will shutdown immediately\nwhen it receives the first exit signal. If the child process is trapping\nexits, then the `terminate` callback is invoked, and the child process\nmust terminate in a reasonable time interval before being abruptly\nterminated by the supervisor.\n\nIn other words, if it is important that a process cleans after itself\nwhen your application or the supervision tree is shutting down, then\nthis process must trap exits and its child specification should specify\nthe proper `:shutdown` value, ensuring it terminates within a reasonable\ninterval.\n\n## Exit reasons and restarts\n\nA supervisor restarts a child process depending on its `:restart` configuration.\nFor example, when `:restart` is set to `:transient`, the supervisor does not\nrestart the child in case it exits with reason `:normal`, `:shutdown` or\n`{:shutdown, term}`.\n\nThose exits also impact logging. By default, behaviours such as GenServers\ndo not emit error logs when the exit reason is `:normal`, `:shutdown` or\n`{:shutdown, term}`.\n\nSo one may ask: which exit reason should I choose? There are three options:\n\n  * `:normal` - in such cases, the exit won't be logged, there is no restart\n    in transient mode, and linked processes do not exit\n\n  * `:shutdown` or `{:shutdown, term}` - in such cases, the exit won't be\n    logged, there is no restart in transient mode, and linked processes exit\n    with the same reason unless they're trapping exits\n\n  * any other term - in such cases, the exit will be logged, there are\n    restarts in transient mode, and linked processes exit with the same\n    reason unless they're trapping exits\n\nGenerally speaking, if you are exiting for expected reasons, you want to use\n`:shutdown` or `{:shutdown, term}`.\n\nNote that the supervisor that reaches maximum restart intensity will exit with\n`:shutdown` reason. In this case the supervisor will only be restarted if its\nchild specification was defined with the `:restart` option set to `:permanent`\n(the default).\n","title":"Supervisor","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"Builds and overrides a child specification.

Tasks are processes meant to execute one particular action throughout their lifetime, often with little or no communication with other processes. The most common use case for tasks is to convert sequential code into concurrent code by computing a value asynchronously: task = Task . async ( fn -&gt; do_some_work ( ) end ) res = do_some_other_work ( ) res + Task . await ( task ) Tasks spawned with async can be awaited on by their caller process (and only their caller) as shown in the example above. They are implemented by spawning a process that sends a message to the caller once the given computation is performed. Besides async/1 and await/2 , tasks can also be started as part of a supervision tree and dynamically spawned on remote nodes. We will explore these scenarios next. async and await One of the common uses of tasks is to convert sequential code into concurrent code with Task.async/1 while keeping its semantics. When invoked, a new process will be created, linked and monitored by the caller. Once the task action finishes, a message will be sent to the caller with the result. Task.await/2 is used to read the message sent by the task. There are two important things to consider when using async : If you are using async tasks, you must await a reply as they are always sent. If you are not expecting a reply, consider using Task.start_link/1 as detailed below. async tasks link the caller and the spawned process. This means that, if the caller crashes, the task will crash too and vice-versa. This is on purpose: if the process meant to receive the result no longer exists, there is no purpose in completing the computation. If this is not desired, you will want to use supervised tasks, described next. Dynamically supervised tasks The Task.Supervisor module allows developers to dynamically create multiple supervised tasks. A short example is: { :ok , pid } = Task.Supervisor . start_link ( ) task = Task.Supervisor . async ( pid , fn -&gt; # Do something end ) Task . await ( task ) However, in the majority of cases, you want to add the task supervisor to your supervision tree: Supervisor . start_link ( [ { Task.Supervisor , name : MyApp.TaskSupervisor } ] , strategy : :one_for_one ) And now you can use async/await by passing the name of the supervisor instead of the pid: Task.Supervisor . async ( MyApp.TaskSupervisor , fn -&gt; # Do something end ) |&gt; Task . await ( ) We encourage developers to rely on supervised tasks as much as possible. Supervised tasks improve the visibility of how many tasks are running at a given moment and enable a variety of patterns that give you explicit control on how to handle the results, errors, and timeouts. Here is a summary: Using Task.Supervisor.start_child/2 allows you to start a fire-and-forget task when you don't care about its results or if it completes successfully or not. Using Task.Supervisor.async/2 + Task.await/2 allows you to execute tasks concurrently and retrieve its result. If the task fails, the caller will also fail. Using Task.Supervisor.async_nolink/2 + Task.yield/2 + Task.shutdown/2 allows you to execute tasks concurrently and retrieve their results or the reason they failed within a given time frame. If the task fails, the caller won't fail. You will receive the error reason either on yield or shutdown . Furthermore, the supervisor guarantees all tasks terminate within a configurable shutdown period when your application shuts down. See the Task.Supervisor module for details on the supported operations. Distributed tasks With Task.Supervisor , it is easy to dynamically start tasks across nodes: # On the remote node named :remote@local Task.Supervisor . start_link ( name : MyApp.DistSupervisor ) # On the client supervisor = { MyApp.DistSupervisor , :remote@local } Task.Supervisor . async ( supervisor , MyMod , :my_fun , [ arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ] ) Note that, when working with distributed tasks, one should use the Task.Supervisor.async/5 function that expects explicit module, function, and arguments, instead of Task.Supervisor.async/3 that works with anonymous functions. That's because anonymous functions expect the same module version to exist on all involved nodes. Check the Agent module documentation for more information on distributed processes as the limitations described there apply to the whole ecosystem. Statically supervised tasks The Task module implements the child_spec/1 function, which allows it to be started directly under a regular Supervisor - instead of a Task.Supervisor - by passing a tuple with a function to run: Supervisor . start_link ( [ { Task , fn -&gt; :some_work end } ] , strategy : :one_for_one ) This is often useful when you need to execute some steps while setting up your supervision tree. For example: to warm up caches, log the initialization status, and such. If you don't want to put the Task code directly under the Supervisor , you can wrap the Task in its own module, similar to how you would do with a GenServer or an Agent : defmodule MyTask do use Task def start_link ( arg ) do Task . start_link ( __MODULE__ , :run , [ arg ] ) end def run ( arg ) do # ... end end And then passing it to the supervisor: Supervisor . start_link ( [ { MyTask , arg } ] , strategy : :one_for_one ) Since these tasks are supervised and not directly linked to the caller, they cannot be awaited on. By default, the functions Task.start/1 and Task.start_link/1 are for fire-and-forget tasks, where you don't care about the results or if it completes successfully or not. use Task defines a child_spec/1 function, allowing the defined module to be put under a supervision tree. The generated child_spec/1 can be customized with the following options: :id - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module :restart - when the child should be restarted, defaults to :temporary :shutdown - how to shut down the child, either immediately or by giving it time to shut down Opposite to GenServer , Agent and Supervisor , a Task has a default :restart of :temporary . This means the task will not be restarted even if it crashes. If you desire the task to be restarted for non-successful exits, do: use Task , restart : :transient If you want the task to always be restarted: use Task , restart : :permanent See the &quot;Child specification&quot; section in the Supervisor module for more detailed information. The @doc annotation immediately preceding use Task will be attached to the generated child_spec/1 function. Ancestor and Caller Tracking Whenever you start a new process, Elixir annotates the parent of that process through the $ancestors key in the process dictionary. This is often used to track the hierarchy inside a supervision tree. For example, we recommend developers to always start tasks under a supervisor. This provides more visibility and allows you to control how those tasks are terminated when a node shuts down. That might look something like Task.Supervisor.start_child(MySupervisor, task_function) . This means that, although your code is the one invoking the task, the actual ancestor of the task is the supervisor, as the supervisor is the one effectively starting it. To track the relationship between your code and the task, we use the $callers key in the process dictionary. Therefore, assuming the Task.Supervisor call above, we have: [ your code ] -- calls -- &gt; [ supervisor ] -- -- spawns -- &gt; [ task ] Which means we store the following relationships: [ your code ] [ supervisor ] &lt;- - ancestor -- [ task ] ^ | | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - caller -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - | The list of callers of the current process can be retrieved from the Process dictionary with Process.get(:&quot;$callers&quot;) . This will return either nil or a list [pid_n, ..., pid2, pid1] with at least one entry where pid_n is the PID that called the current process, pid2 called pid_n , and pid2 was called by pid1 . If a task crashes, the callers field is included as part of the log message metadata under the :callers key.","ref":"Task.html","source_doc":"Conveniences for spawning and awaiting tasks.\n\nTasks are processes meant to execute one particular\naction throughout their lifetime, often with little or no\ncommunication with other processes.

This means a failure in a task terminates the caller process and a failure in the caller process terminates all tasks. When streamed, each task will emit {:ok, value} upon successful completion or {:exit, reason} if the caller is trapping exits. It's possible to have {:exit, {element, reason}} for exits using the :zip_input_on_exit option. The order of results depends on the value of the :ordered option. The level of concurrency and the time tasks are allowed to run can be controlled via options (see the &quot;Options&quot; section below). Consider using Task.Supervisor.async_stream/6 to start tasks under a supervisor. If you find yourself trapping exits to ensure errors in the tasks do not terminate the caller process, consider using Task.Supervisor.async_stream_nolink/6 to start tasks that are not linked to the caller process. Options :max_concurrency - sets the maximum number of tasks to run at the same time. Defaults to System.schedulers_online/0 . :ordered - whether the results should be returned in the same order as the input stream. When the output is ordered, Elixir may need to buffer results to emit them in the original order. Setting this option to false disables the need to buffer at the cost of removing ordering. This is also useful when you're using the tasks only for the side effects. Note that regardless of what :ordered is set to, the tasks will process asynchronously. If you need to process elements in order, consider using Enum.map/2 or Enum.each/2 instead. Defaults to true . :timeout - the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds or :infinity ) each task is allowed to execute for. Defaults to 5000 . :on_timeout - what to do when a task times out. The possible values are: :exit (default) - the caller (the process that spawned the tasks) exits. :kill_task - the task that timed out is killed. The value emitted for that task is {:exit, :timeout} . :zip_input_on_exit - (since v1.14.0) adds the original input to :exit tuples. The value emitted for that task is {:exit, {input, reason}} , where input is the collection element that caused an exited during processing. Defaults to false . Example Let's build a stream and then enumerate it: stream = Task . async_stream ( collection , Mod , :expensive_fun , [ ] ) Enum . to_list ( stream ) The concurrency can be increased or decreased using the :max_concurrency option. For example, if the tasks are IO heavy, the value can be increased: max_concurrency = System . schedulers_online ( ) * 2 stream = Task . async_stream ( collection , Mod , :expensive_fun , [ ] , max_concurrency : max_concurrency ) Enum . to_list ( stream ) If you do not care about the results of the computation, you can run the stream with Stream.run/1 . Also set ordered: false , as you don't care about the order of the results either: stream = Task . async_stream ( collection , Mod , :expensive_fun , [ ] , ordered : false ) Stream . run ( stream ) First async tasks to complete You can also use async_stream/3 to execute M tasks and find the N tasks to complete. For example: [ &amp; heavy_call_1 / 0 , &amp; heavy_call_2 / 0 , &amp; heavy_call_3 / 0 ] |&gt; Task . async_stream ( fn fun -&gt; fun . ( ) end , ordered : false , max_concurrency : 3 ) |&gt; Stream . filter ( &amp; match? ( { :ok , _ } , &amp;1 ) ) |&gt; Enum . take ( 2 ) In the example above, we are executing three tasks and waiting for the first 2 to complete. We use Stream.filter/2 to restrict ourselves only to successfully completed tasks, and then use Enum.take/2 to retrieve N items. Note it is important to set both ordered: false and max_concurrency: M , where M is the number of tasks, to make sure all calls execute concurrently. Attention: unbound async + take If you want to potentially process a high number of items and keep only part of the results, you may end-up processing more items than desired. Let's see an example: 1 .. 100 |&gt; Task . async_stream ( fn i -&gt; Process . sleep ( 100 ) IO . puts ( to_string ( i ) ) end ) |&gt; Enum . take ( 10 ) Running the example above in a machine with 8 cores will process 16 items, even though you want only 10 elements, since async_stream/3 process items concurrently. That's because it will process 8 elements at once. Then all 8 elements complete at roughly the same time, causing 8 elements to be kicked off for processing. Out of these extra 8, only 2 will be used, and the rest will be terminated. Depending on the problem, you can filter or limit the number of elements upfront: 1 .. 100 |&gt; Stream . take ( 10 ) |&gt; Task . async_stream ( fn i -&gt; Process . sleep ( 100 ) IO . puts ( to_string ( i ) ) end ) |&gt; Enum . to_list ( ) In other cases, you likely want to tweak :max_concurrency to limit how many elements may be over processed at the cost of reducing concurrency.

This is typically done when you want to customize how your own structs are inspected in logs and the terminal. This documentation refers to implementing the Inspect protocol for your own data structures. To learn more about using inspect, see Kernel.inspect/2 and IO.inspect/2 . Inspect representation There are typically three choices of inspect representation. In order to understand them, let's imagine we have the following User struct: defmodule User do defstruct [ :id , :name , :address ] end Our choices are: Print the struct using Elixir's struct syntax, for example: %User{address: &quot;Earth&quot;, id: 13, name: &quot;Jane&quot;} . This is the default representation and best choice if all struct fields are public. Print using the #User&lt;...&gt; notation, for example: #User&lt;id: 13, name: &quot;Jane&quot;, ...&gt; . This notation does not emit valid Elixir code and is typically used when the struct has private fields (for example, you may want to hide the field :address to redact person identifiable information). Print the struct using the expression syntax, for example: User.new(13, &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;Earth&quot;) . This assumes there is a User.new/3 function. This option is mostly used as an alternative to option 2 for representing custom data structures, such as MapSet , Date.Range , and others. You can implement the Inspect protocol for your own structs while adhering to the conventions above. Option 1 is the default representation and you can quickly achieve option 2 by deriving the Inspect protocol. For option 3, you need your custom implementation. Deriving The Inspect protocol can be derived to customize the order of fields (the default is alphabetical) and hide certain fields from structs, so they don't show up in logs, inspects and similar. The latter is especially useful for fields containing private information. The supported options are: :only - only include the given fields when inspecting. :except - remove the given fields when inspecting. :optional - (since v1.14.0) do not include a field if it matches its default value. This can be used to simplify the struct representation at the cost of hiding information. Whenever :only or :except are used to restrict fields, the struct will be printed using the #User&lt;...&gt; notation, as the struct can no longer be copy and pasted as valid Elixir code. Let's see an example: defmodule User do @derive { Inspect , only : [ :id , :name ] } defstruct [ :id , :name , :address ] end inspect ( % User { id : 1 , name : &quot;Jane&quot; , address : &quot;Earth&quot; } ) #=&gt; #User&lt;id: 1, name: &quot;Jane&quot;, ...&gt; If you use only the :optional option, the struct will still be printed as %User{...} . Custom implementation You can also define your custom protocol implementation by defining the inspect/2 function. The function receives the entity to be inspected followed by the inspecting options, represented by the struct Inspect.Opts . Building of the algebra document is done with Inspect.Algebra . Many times, inspecting a structure can be implemented in function of existing entities. For example, here is MapSet 's inspect/2 implementation: defimpl Inspect , for : MapSet do import Inspect.Algebra def inspect ( map_set , opts ) do concat ( [ &quot;MapSet.new(&quot; , Inspect.List . inspect ( MapSet . to_list ( map_set ) , opts ) , &quot;)&quot; ] ) end end The concat/1 function comes from Inspect.Algebra and it concatenates algebra documents together. In the example above it is concatenating the string &quot;MapSet.new(&quot; , the document returned by Inspect.Algebra.to_doc/2 , and the final string &quot;)&quot; . Therefore, the MapSet with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 will be printed as: iex&gt; MapSet . new ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , fn x -&gt; x * 2 end ) MapSet . new ( [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] ) In other words, MapSet 's inspect representation returns an expression that, when evaluated, builds the MapSet itself. Error handling In case there is an error while your structure is being inspected, Elixir will raise an ArgumentError error and will automatically fall back to a raw representation for printing the structure. You can, however, access the underlying error by invoking the Inspect implementation directly. For example, to test Inspect.MapSet above, you can invoke it as: Inspect.MapSet . inspect ( MapSet . new ( ) , % Inspect.Opts { } )","ref":"Inspect.html","source_doc":"The `Inspect` protocol converts an Elixir data structure into an\nalgebra document.\n\nThis is typically done when you want to customize how your own\nstructs are inspected in logs and the terminal.\n\nThis documentation refers to implementing the `Inspect` protocol\nfor your own data structures.

Implementation details The implementation of Inspect.Algebra is based on the Strictly Pretty paper by Lindig which builds on top of previous pretty printing algorithms but is tailored to strict languages, such as Elixir. The core idea in the paper is the use of explicit document groups which are rendered as flat (breaks as spaces) or as break (breaks as newlines). This implementation provides two types of breaks: :strict and :flex . When a group does not fit, all strict breaks are treated as newlines.

A protocol specifies an API that should be defined by its implementations. A protocol is defined with Kernel.defprotocol/2 and its implementations with Kernel.defimpl/3 . A real case In Elixir, we have two nouns for checking how many items there are in a data structure: length and size . length means the information must be computed. For example, length(list) needs to traverse the whole list to calculate its length. On the other hand, tuple_size(tuple) and byte_size(binary) do not depend on the tuple and binary size as the size information is precomputed in the data structure. Although Elixir includes specific functions such as tuple_size , binary_size and map_size , sometimes we want to be able to retrieve the size of a data structure regardless of its type. In Elixir we can write polymorphic code, i.e. code that works with different shapes/types, by using protocols. A size protocol could be implemented as follows: defprotocol Size do @doc &quot;Calculates the size (and not the length!) of a data structure&quot; def size ( data ) end Now that the protocol can be implemented for every data structure the protocol may have a compliant implementation for: defimpl Size , for : BitString do def size ( binary ) , do : byte_size ( binary ) end defimpl Size , for : Map do def size ( map ) , do : map_size ( map ) end defimpl Size , for : Tuple do def size ( tuple ) , do : tuple_size ( tuple ) end Finally, we can use the Size protocol to call the correct implementation: Size . size ( { 1 , 2 } ) # =&gt; 2 Size . size ( %{ key : :value } ) # =&gt; 1 Note that we didn't implement it for lists as we don't have the size information on lists, rather its value needs to be computed with length . The data structure you are implementing the protocol for must be the first argument to all functions defined in the protocol. It is possible to implement protocols for all Elixir types: Structs (see the &quot;Protocols and Structs&quot; section below) Tuple Atom List BitString Integer Float Function PID Map Port Reference Any (see the &quot;Fallback to Any &quot; section below) Protocols and Structs The real benefit of protocols comes when mixed with structs. For instance, Elixir ships with many data types implemented as structs, like MapSet . We can implement the Size protocol for those types as well: defimpl Size , for : MapSet do def size ( map_set ) , do : MapSet . size ( map_set ) end When implementing a protocol for a struct, the :for option can be omitted if the defimpl/3 call is inside the module that defines the struct: defmodule User do defstruct [ :email , :name ] defimpl Size do # two fields def size ( % User { } ) , do : 2 end end If a protocol implementation is not found for a given type, invoking the protocol will raise unless it is configured to fall back to Any . Conveniences for building implementations on top of existing ones are also available, look at defstruct/1 for more information about deriving protocols. Fallback to Any In some cases, it may be convenient to provide a default implementation for all types. This can be achieved by setting the @fallback_to_any attribute to true in the protocol definition: defprotocol Size do @fallback_to_any true def size ( data ) end The Size protocol can now be implemented for Any : defimpl Size , for : Any do def size ( _ ) , do : 0 end Although the implementation above is arguably not a reasonable one. For example, it makes no sense to say a PID or an integer have a size of 0 . That's one of the reasons why @fallback_to_any is an opt-in behaviour. For the majority of protocols, raising an error when a protocol is not implemented is the proper behaviour. Multiple implementations Protocols can also be implemented for multiple types at once: defprotocol Reversible do def reverse ( term ) end defimpl Reversible , for : [ Map , List ] do def reverse ( term ) , do : Enum . reverse ( term ) end Inside defimpl/3 , you can use @protocol to access the protocol being implemented and @for to access the module it is being defined for. Types Defining a protocol automatically defines a zero-arity type named t , which can be used as follows: @spec print_size ( Size . t ( ) ) :: :ok def print_size ( data ) do result = case Size . size ( data ) do 0 -&gt; &quot;data has no items&quot; 1 -&gt; &quot;data has one item&quot; n -&gt; &quot;data has \#{ n } items&quot; end IO . puts ( result ) end The @spec above expresses that all types allowed to implement the given protocol are valid argument types for the given function. Reflection Any protocol module contains three extra functions: __protocol__/1 - returns the protocol information. The function takes one of the following atoms: :consolidated? - returns whether the protocol is consolidated :functions - returns a keyword list of protocol functions and their arities :impls - if consolidated, returns {:consolidated, modules} with the list of modules implementing the protocol, otherwise :not_consolidated :module - the protocol module atom name impl_for/1 - returns the module that implements the protocol for the given argument, nil otherwise impl_for!/1 - same as above but raises Protocol.UndefinedError if an implementation is not found For example, for the Enumerable protocol we have: iex&gt; Enumerable . __protocol__ ( :functions ) [ count : 1 , member? : 2 , reduce : 3 , slice : 1 ] iex&gt; Enumerable . impl_for ( [ ] ) Enumerable.List iex&gt; Enumerable . impl_for ( 42 ) nil In addition, every protocol implementation module contains the __impl__/1 function. The function takes one of the following atoms: :for - returns the module responsible for the data structure of the protocol implementation :protocol - returns the protocol module for which this implementation is provided For example, the module implementing the Enumerable protocol for lists is Enumerable.List . Therefore, we can invoke __impl__/1 on this module: iex(1)&gt; Enumerable.List . __impl__ ( :for ) List iex(2)&gt; Enumerable.List . __impl__ ( :protocol ) Enumerable Consolidation In order to speed up protocol dispatching, whenever all protocol implementations are known up-front, typically after all Elixir code in a project is compiled, Elixir provides a feature called protocol consolidation . Consolidation directly links protocols to their implementations in a way that invoking a function from a consolidated protocol is equivalent to invoking two remote functions. Protocol consolidation is applied by default to all Mix projects during compilation. This may be an issue during test. For instance, if you want to implement a protocol during test, the implementation will have no effect, as the protocol has already been consolidated. One possible solution is to include compilation directories that are specific to your test environment in your mix.exs: def project do ... elixirc_paths : elixirc_paths ( Mix . env ( ) ) ... end defp elixirc_paths ( :test ) , do : [ &quot;lib&quot; , &quot;test/support&quot; ] defp elixirc_paths ( _ ) , do : [ &quot;lib&quot; ] And then you can define the implementations specific to the test environment inside test/support/some_file.ex . Another approach is to disable protocol consolidation during tests in your mix.exs: def project do ... consolidate_protocols : Mix . env ( ) != :test ... end If you are using Mix.install/2 , you can do by passing the consolidate_protocols option: Mix . install ( deps , consolidate_protocols : false ) Although doing so is not recommended as it may affect the performance of your code. Finally, note all protocols are compiled with debug_info set to true , regardless of the option set by the elixirc compiler. The debug info is used for consolidation and it is removed after consolidation unless globally set.","ref":"Protocol.html","source_doc":"Reference and functions for working with protocols.\n\nA protocol specifies an API that should be defined by its\nimplementations.

This module complements Erlang's :code module to add behaviour which is specific to Elixir. For functions to manipulate Elixir's AST (rather than evaluating it), see the Macro module. Working with files This module contains three functions for compiling and evaluating files. Here is a summary of them and their behaviour: require_file/2 - compiles a file and tracks its name. It does not compile the file again if it has been previously required. compile_file/2 - compiles a file without tracking its name. Compiles the file multiple times when invoked multiple times. eval_file/2 - evaluates the file contents without tracking its name. It returns the result of the last expression in the file, instead of the modules defined in it. Evaluated files do not trigger the compilation tracers described in the next section. In a nutshell, the first must be used when you want to keep track of the files handled by the system, to avoid the same file from being compiled multiple times. This is common in scripts. compile_file/2 must be used when you are interested in the modules defined in a file, without tracking. eval_file/2 should be used when you are interested in the result of evaluating the file rather than the modules it defines. The functions above work with Elixir source. If you want to work with modules compiled to bytecode, which have the .beam extension and are typically found below the _build directory of a Mix project, see the functions in Erlang's :code module. Code loading on the Erlang VM Erlang has two modes to load code: interactive and embedded. By default, the Erlang VM runs in interactive mode, where modules are loaded as needed. In embedded mode the opposite happens, as all modules need to be loaded upfront or explicitly. You can use ensure_loaded/1 (as well as ensure_loaded?/1 and ensure_loaded!/1 ) to check if a module is loaded before using it and act. ensure_compiled/1 and ensure_compiled!/1 Elixir also includes ensure_compiled/1 and ensure_compiled!/1 functions that are a superset of ensure_loaded/1 . Since Elixir's compilation happens in parallel, in some situations you may need to use a module that was not yet compiled, therefore it can't even be loaded. When invoked, ensure_compiled/1 and ensure_compiled!/1 halt the compilation of the caller until the module becomes available. Note that the distinction between ensure_compiled/1 and ensure_compiled!/1 is important: if you are using ensure_compiled!/1 , you are indicating to the compiler that you can only continue if said module is available. If you are using Code.ensure_compiled/1 , you are implying you may continue without the module and therefore Elixir may return {:error, :unavailable} for cases where the module is not yet available (but may be available later on). For those reasons, developers must typically use Code.ensure_compiled!/1 . In particular, do not do this: case Code . ensure_compiled ( module ) do { :module , _ } -&gt; module { :error , _ } -&gt; raise ... end Finally, note you only need ensure_compiled!/1 to check for modules being defined within the same project. It does not apply to modules from dependencies as dependencies are always compiled upfront. In most cases, ensure_loaded/1 is enough. ensure_compiled!/1 must be used in rare cases, usually involving macros that need to invoke a module for callback information. The use of ensure_compiled/1 is even less likely. Compilation tracers Elixir supports compilation tracers, which allow modules to observe constructs handled by the Elixir compiler when compiling files. A tracer is a module that implements the trace/2 function. The function receives the event name as first argument and Macro.Env as second and it must return :ok . It is very important for a tracer to do as little work as possible synchronously and dispatch the bulk of the work to a separate process. Slow tracers will slow down compilation . You can configure your list of tracers via put_compiler_option/2 . The following events are available to tracers: :start - (since v1.11.0) invoked whenever the compiler starts to trace a new lexical context. A lexical context is started when compiling a new file or when defining a module within a function. Note evaluated code does not start a new lexical context (because they don't track unused aliases, imports, etc) but defining a module inside evaluated code will. Note this event may be emitted in parallel, where multiple files/modules invoke :start and run at the same time. The value of the lexical_tracker of the macro environment, albeit opaque, can be used to uniquely identify the environment. :stop - (since v1.11.0) invoked whenever the compiler stops tracing a new lexical context, such as a new file. {:import, meta, module, opts} - traced whenever module is imported. meta is the import AST metadata and opts are the import options. {:imported_function, meta, module, name, arity} and {:imported_macro, meta, module, name, arity} - traced whenever an imported function or macro is invoked. meta is the call AST metadata, module is the module the import is from, followed by the name and arity of the imported function/macro. A :remote_function/:remote_macro event may still be emitted for the imported module/name/arity. {:alias, meta, alias, as, opts} - traced whenever alias is aliased to as . meta is the alias AST metadata and opts are the alias options. {:alias_expansion, meta, as, alias} traced whenever there is an alias expansion for a previously defined alias , i.e. when the user writes as which is expanded to alias . meta is the alias expansion AST metadata. {:alias_reference, meta, module} - traced whenever there is an alias in the code, i.e. whenever the user writes MyModule.Foo.Bar in the code, regardless if it was expanded or not. {:require, meta, module, opts} - traced whenever module is required. meta is the require AST metadata and opts are the require options. If the meta option contains the :from_macro , then module was called from within a macro and therefore must be treated as a compile-time dependency. {:struct_expansion, meta, module, keys} - traced whenever module 's struct is expanded. meta is the struct AST metadata and keys are the keys being used by expansion {:remote_function, meta, module, name, arity} and {:remote_macro, meta, module, name, arity} - traced whenever a remote function or macro is referenced. meta is the call AST metadata, module is the invoked module, followed by the name and arity . {:local_function, meta, name, arity} and {:local_macro, meta, name, arity} - traced whenever a local function or macro is referenced. meta is the call AST metadata, followed by the name and arity . {:compile_env, app, path, return} - traced whenever Application.compile_env/3 or Application.compile_env!/2 are called. app is an atom, path is a list of keys to traverse in the application environment and return is either {:ok, value} or :error . {:on_module, bytecode, _ignore} - (since v1.13.0) traced whenever a module is defined. This is equivalent to the @after_compile callback and invoked after any @after_compile in the given module. The third element is currently :none but it may provide more metadata in the future. It is best to ignore it at the moment. Note that Module functions expecting not yet compiled modules (such as Module.definitions_in/1 ) are still available at the time this event is emitted. The :tracers compiler option can be combined with the :parser_options compiler option to enrich the metadata of the traced events above. New events may be added at any time in the future, therefore it is advised for the trace/2 function to have a &quot;catch-all&quot; clause. Below is an example tracer that prints all remote function invocations: defmodule MyTracer do def trace ( { :remote_function , _meta , module , name , arity } , env ) do IO . puts &quot; \#{ env . file } : \#{ env . line } \#{ inspect ( module ) } . \#{ name } / \#{ arity } &quot; :ok end def trace ( _event , _env ) do :ok end end","ref":"Code.html","source_doc":"Utilities for managing code compilation, code evaluation, and code loading.\n\nThis module complements Erlang's [`:code` module](`:code`)\nto add behaviour which is specific to Elixir.

Defaults to true . This option changes the AST. Design principles The formatter was designed under three principles. First, the formatter never changes the semantics of the code. This means the input AST and the output AST are almost always equivalent. The only cases where the formatter will change the AST is when the input AST would cause compiler warnings and the output AST won't. The cases where the formatter changes the AST can be disabled through formatting options if desired. The second principle is to provide as little configuration as possible. This eases the formatter adoption by removing contention points while making sure a single style is followed consistently by the community as a whole. The formatter does not hard code names. The formatter will not behave specially because a function is named defmodule , def , or the like. This principle mirrors Elixir's goal of being an extensible language where developers can extend the language with new constructs as if they were part of the language. When it is absolutely necessary to change behaviour based on the name, this behaviour should be configurable, such as the :locals_without_parens option. Running the formatter The formatter attempts to fit the most it can on a single line and introduces line breaks wherever possible when it cannot. In some cases, this may lead to undesired formatting. Therefore, some code generated by the formatter may not be aesthetically pleasing and may require explicit intervention from the developer . That's why we do not recommend to run the formatter blindly in an existing codebase. Instead you should format and sanity check each formatted file. For example, the formatter may break a long function definition over multiple clauses: def my_function ( % User { name : name , age : age , ... } , arg1 , arg2 ) do ... end While the code above is completely valid, you may prefer to match on the struct variables inside the function body in order to keep the definition on a single line: def my_function ( % User { } = user , arg1 , arg2 ) do %{ name : name , age : age , ... } = user ... end In some situations, you can use the fact the formatter does not generate elegant code as a hint for refactoring. Take this code: def board? ( board_id , % User { } = user , available_permissions , required_permissions ) do Tracker.OrganizationMembers . user_in_organization? ( user . id , board . organization_id ) and required_permissions == Enum . to_list ( MapSet . intersection ( MapSet . new ( required_permissions ) , MapSet . new ( available_permissions ) ) ) end The code above has very long lines and running the formatter is not going to address this issue. In fact, the formatter may make it more obvious that you have complex expressions: def board? ( board_id , % User { } = user , available_permissions , required_permissions ) do Tracker.OrganizationMembers . user_in_organization? ( user . id , board . organization_id ) and required_permissions == Enum . to_list ( MapSet . intersection ( MapSet . new ( required_permissions ) , MapSet . new ( available_permissions ) ) ) end Take such cases as a suggestion that your code should be refactored: def board? ( board_id , % User { } = user , available_permissions , required_permissions ) do Tracker.OrganizationMembers . user_in_organization? ( user . id , board . organization_id ) and matching_permissions? ( required_permissions , available_permissions ) end defp matching_permissions? ( required_permissions , available_permissions ) do intersection = required_permissions |&gt; MapSet . new ( ) |&gt; MapSet . intersection ( MapSet . new ( available_permissions ) ) |&gt; Enum . to_list ( ) required_permissions == intersection end To sum it up: since the formatter cannot change the semantics of your code, sometimes it is necessary to tweak or refactor the code to get optimal formatting. To help better understand how to control the formatter, we describe in the next sections the cases where the formatter keeps the user encoding and how to control multiline expressions. Line length Another point about the formatter is that the :line_length configuration is a guideline. In many cases, it is not possible for the formatter to break your code apart, which means it will go over the line length. For example, if you have a long string: &quot;this is a very long string that will go over the line length&quot; The formatter doesn't know how to break it apart without changing the code underlying syntax representation, so it is up to you to step in: &quot;this is a very long string &quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;that will go over the line length&quot; The string concatenation makes the code fit on a single line and also gives more options to the formatter. This may also appear in do/end blocks, where the do keyword (or -&gt; ) may go over the line length because there is no opportunity for the formatter to introduce a line break in a readable way. For example, if you do: case very_long_expression ( ) do end And only the do keyword is above the line length, Elixir will not emit this: case very_long_expression ( ) do end So it prefers to not touch the line at all and leave do above the line limit. Keeping user's formatting The formatter respects the input format in some cases. Those are listed below: Insignificant digits in numbers are kept as is. The formatter, however, always inserts underscores for decimal numbers with more than 5 digits and converts hexadecimal digits to uppercase Strings, charlists, atoms and sigils are kept as is. No character is automatically escaped or unescaped. The choice of delimiter is also respected from the input Newlines inside blocks are kept as in the input except for: expressions that take multiple lines will always have an empty line before and after and 2) empty lines are always squeezed together into a single empty line The choice between :do keyword and do - end blocks is left to the user Lists, tuples, bitstrings, maps, structs and function calls will be broken into multiple lines if they are followed by a newline in the opening bracket and preceded by a new line in the closing bracket Newlines before certain operators (such as the pipeline operators) and before other operators (such as comparison operators) The behaviours above are not guaranteed. We may remove or add new rules in the future. The goal of documenting them is to provide better understanding on what to expect from the formatter. Multi-line lists, maps, tuples, and the like You can force lists, tuples, bitstrings, maps, structs and function calls to have one entry per line by adding a newline after the opening bracket and a new line before the closing bracket lines. For example: [ foo , bar ] If there are no newlines around the brackets, then the formatter will try to fit everything on a single line, such that the snippet below [ foo , bar ] will be formatted as [ foo , bar ] You can also force function calls and keywords to be rendered on multiple lines by having each entry on its own line: defstruct name : nil , age : 0 The code above will be kept with one keyword entry per line by the formatter. To avoid that, just squash everything into a single line. Parens and no parens in function calls Elixir has two syntaxes for function calls. With parens and no parens. By default, Elixir will add parens to all calls except for: calls that have do - end blocks local calls without parens where the name and arity of the local call is also listed under :locals_without_parens (except for calls with arity 0, where the compiler always require parens) The choice of parens and no parens also affects indentation. When a function call with parens doesn't fit on the same line, the formatter introduces a newline around parens and indents the arguments with two spaces: some_call ( arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ) On the other hand, function calls without parens are always indented by the function call length itself, like this: some_call arg1 , arg2 , arg3 If the last argument is a data structure, such as maps and lists, and the beginning of the data structure fits on the same line as the function call, then no indentation happens, this allows code like this: Enum . reduce ( some_collection , initial_value , fn element , acc -&gt; # code end ) some_function_without_parens %{ foo : :bar , baz : :bat } Code comments The formatter also handles code comments in a way to guarantee a space is always added between the beginning of the comment (#) and the next character. The formatter also extracts all trailing comments to their previous line. For example, the code below hello #world will be rewritten to # world hello Because code comments are handled apart from the code representation (AST), there are some situations where code comments are seen as ambiguous by the code formatter. For example, the comment in the anonymous function below fn arg1 -&gt; body1 # comment arg2 -&gt; body2 end and in this one fn arg1 -&gt; body1 # comment arg2 -&gt; body2 end are considered equivalent (the nesting is discarded alongside most of user formatting). In such cases, the code formatter will always format to the latter.

That's why we\ndo not recommend to run the formatter blindly in an existing codebase.\nInstead you should format and sanity check each formatted file.\n\nFor example, the formatter may break a long function definition over\nmultiple clauses:\n\n    def my_function(\n      %User{name: name, age: age, ...},\n      arg1,\n      arg2\n    ) do\n      ...\n    end\n\nWhile the code above is completely valid, you may prefer to match on\nthe struct variables inside the function body in order to keep the\ndefinition on a single line:\n\n    def my_function(%User{} = user, arg1, arg2) do\n      %{name: name, age: age, ...} = user\n      ...\n    end\n\nIn some situations, you can use the fact the formatter does not generate\nelegant code as a hint for refactoring. Take this code:\n\n    def board?(board_id, %User{} = user, available_permissions, required_permissions) do\n      Tracker.OrganizationMembers.user_in_organization?(user.id, board.organization_id) and\n        required_permissions == Enum.to_list(MapSet.intersection(MapSet.new(required_permissions), MapSet.new(available_permissions)))\n    end\n\nThe code above has very long lines and running the formatter is not going\nto address this issue. In fact, the formatter may make it more obvious that\nyou have complex expressions:\n\n    def board?(board_id, %User{} = user, available_permissions, required_permissions) do\n      Tracker.OrganizationMembers.user_in_organization?(user.id, board.organization_id) and\n        required_permissions ==\n          Enum.to_list(\n            MapSet.intersection(\n              MapSet.new(required_permissions),\n              MapSet.new(available_permissions)\n            )\n          )\n    end\n\nTake such cases as a suggestion that your code should be refactored:\n\n    def board?(board_id, %User{} = user, available_permissions, required_permissions) do\n      Tracker.OrganizationMembers.user_in_organization?(user.id, board.organization_id) and\n        matching_permissions?(required_permissions, available_permissions)\n    end\n\n    defp matching_permissions?(required_permissions, available_permissions) do\n      intersection =\n        required_permissions\n        |> MapSet.new()\n        |> MapSet.intersection(MapSet.new(available_permissions))\n        |> Enum.to_list()\n\n      required_permissions == intersection\n    end\n\nTo sum it up: since the formatter cannot change the semantics of your\ncode, sometimes it is necessary to tweak or refactor the code to get\noptimal formatting. To help better understand how to control the formatter,\nwe describe in the next sections the cases where the formatter keeps the\nuser encoding and how to control multiline expressions.\n\n## Line length\n\nAnother point about the formatter is that the `:line_length` configuration\nis a guideline. In many cases, it is not possible for the formatter to break\nyour code apart, which means it will go over the line length. For example,\nif you have a long string:\n\n    \"this is a very long string that will go over the line length\"\n\nThe formatter doesn't know how to break it apart without changing the\ncode underlying syntax representation, so it is up to you to step in:\n\n    \"this is a very long string \" <>\n       \"that will go over the line length\"\n\nThe string concatenation makes the code fit on a single line and also\ngives more options to the formatter.\n\nThis may also appear in do/end blocks, where the `do` keyword (or `->`)\nmay go over the line length because there is no opportunity for the\nformatter to introduce a line break in a readable way. For example,\nif you do:\n\n    case very_long_expression() do\n    end\n\nAnd only the `do` keyword is above the line length, Elixir **will not**\nemit this:\n\n    case very_long_expression()\n    do\n    end\n\nSo it prefers to not touch the line at all and leave `do` above the\nline limit.\n\n## Keeping user's formatting\n\nThe formatter respects the input format in some cases. Those are\nlisted below:\n\n  * Insignificant digits in numbers are kept as is. The formatter,\n    however, always inserts underscores for decimal numbers with more\n    than 5 digits and converts hexadecimal digits to uppercase\n\n  * Strings, charlists, atoms and sigils are kept as is. No character\n    is automatically escaped or unescaped. The choice of delimiter is\n    also respected from the input\n\n  * Newlines inside blocks are kept as in the input except for:\n    1) expressions that take multiple lines will always have an empty\n    line before and after and 2) empty lines are always squeezed\n    together into a single empty line\n\n  * The choice between `:do` keyword and `do`-`end` blocks is left\n    to the user\n\n  * Lists, tuples, bitstrings, maps, structs and function calls will be\n    broken into multiple lines if they are followed by a newline in the\n    opening bracket and preceded by a new line in the closing bracket\n\n  * Newlines before certain operators (such as the pipeline operators)\n    and before other operators (such as comparison operators)\n\nThe behaviours above are not guaranteed. We may remove or add new\nrules in the future. The goal of documenting them is to provide better\nunderstanding on what to expect from the formatter.\n\n### Multi-line lists, maps, tuples, and the like\n\nYou can force lists, tuples, bitstrings, maps, structs and function\ncalls to have one entry per line by adding a newline after the opening\nbracket and a new line before the closing bracket lines. For example:\n\n    [\n      foo,\n      bar\n    ]\n\nIf there are no newlines around the brackets, then the formatter will\ntry to fit everything on a single line, such that the snippet below\n\n    [foo,\n     bar]\n\nwill be formatted as\n\n    [foo, bar]\n\nYou can also force function calls and keywords to be rendered on multiple\nlines by having each entry on its own line:\n\n    defstruct name: nil,\n              age: 0\n\nThe code above will be kept with one keyword entry per line by the\nformatter. To avoid that, just squash everything into a single line.\n\n### Parens and no parens in function calls\n\nElixir has two syntaxes for function calls. With parens and no parens.\nBy default, Elixir will add parens to all calls except for:\n\n  1. calls that have `do`-`end` blocks\n  2. local calls without parens where the name and arity of the local\n     call is also listed under `:locals_without_parens` (except for\n     calls with arity 0, where the compiler always require parens)\n\nThe choice of parens and no parens also affects indentation. When a\nfunction call with parens doesn't fit on the same line, the formatter\nintroduces a newline around parens and indents the arguments with two\nspaces:\n\n    some_call(\n      arg1,\n      arg2,\n      arg3\n    )\n\nOn the other hand, function calls without parens are always indented\nby the function call length itself, like this:\n\n    some_call arg1,\n              arg2,\n              arg3\n\nIf the last argument is a data structure, such as maps and lists, and\nthe beginning of the data structure fits on the same line as the function\ncall, then no indentation happens, this allows code like this:\n\n    Enum.reduce(some_collection, initial_value, fn element, acc ->\n      # code\n    end)\n\n    some_function_without_parens %{\n      foo: :bar,\n      baz: :bat\n    }\n\n## Code comments\n\nThe formatter also handles code comments in a way to guarantee a space\nis always added between the beginning of the comment (#) and the next\ncharacter.\n\nThe formatter also extracts all trailing comments to their previous line.\nFor example, the code below\n\n    hello #world\n\nwill be rewritten to\n\n    # world\n    hello\n\nBecause code comments are handled apart from the code representation (AST),\nthere are some situations where code comments are seen as ambiguous by the\ncode formatter. For example, the comment in the anonymous function below\n\n    fn\n      arg1 ->\n        body1\n        # comment\n\n      arg2 ->\n        body2\n    end\n\nand in this one\n\n    fn\n      arg1 ->\n        body1\n\n      # comment\n      arg2 ->\n        body2\n    end\n\nare considered equivalent (the nesting is discarded alongside most of\nuser formatting). In such cases, the code formatter will always format to\nthe latter.\n\n## Newlines\n\nThe formatter converts all newlines in code from `\\r\\n` to `\\n`.\n","title":"Code.format_string!/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Returns the value of a given compiler option.

Macros are compile-time constructs that receive Elixir's AST as input and return Elixir's AST as output. Many of the functions in this module exist precisely to work with Elixir AST, to traverse, query, and transform it. Let's see a simple example that shows the difference between functions and macros: defmodule Example do defmacro macro_inspect ( value ) do IO . inspect ( value ) value end def fun_inspect ( value ) do IO . inspect ( value ) value end end Now let's give it a try: import Example macro_inspect ( 1 ) #=&gt; 1 #=&gt; 1 fun_inspect ( 1 ) #=&gt; 1 #=&gt; 1 So far they behave the same, as we are passing an integer as argument. But let's see what happens when we pass an expression: macro_inspect ( 1 + 2 ) #=&gt; {:+, [line: 3], [1, 2]} #=&gt; 3 fun_inspect ( 1 + 2 ) #=&gt; 3 #=&gt; 3 The macro receives the representation of the code given as argument, while a function receives the result of the code given as argument. A macro must return a superset of the code representation. See input/0 and output/0 for more information. To learn more about Elixir's AST and how to build them programmatically, see quote/2 . Evaluating code The functions in this module do not evaluate code. In fact, evaluating code from macros is often an anti-pattern. For code evaluation, see the Code module. Custom Sigils Macros are also commonly used to implement custom sigils. Sigils start with ~ and are followed by one lowercase letter or by one or more uppercase letters, and then a separator (see the Syntax Reference ). One example is ~D[2020-10-13] to define a date. To create a custom sigil, define a macro with the name sigil_{identifier} that takes two arguments. The first argument will be the string, the second will be a charlist containing any modifiers. If the sigil is lower case (such as sigil_x ) then the string argument will allow interpolation. If the sigil is one or more upper case letters (such as sigil_X and sigil_EXAMPLE ) then the string will not be interpolated. Valid modifiers are ASCII letters and digits. Any other character will cause a syntax error. Single-letter sigils are typically reserved to the language. Multi-letter sigils are uppercased and extensively used by the community to embed alternative markups and data-types within Elixir source code. The module containing the custom sigil must be imported before the sigil syntax can be used. Examples As an example, let's define a sigil ~x and sigil ~X which return its contents as a string. However, if the r modifier is given, it reverses the string instead: defmodule MySigils do defmacro sigil_x ( term , [ ?r ] ) do quote do unquote ( term ) |&gt; String . reverse ( ) end end defmacro sigil_x ( term , _modifiers ) do term end defmacro sigil_X ( term , [ ?r ] ) do quote do unquote ( term ) |&gt; String . reverse ( ) end end defmacro sigil_X ( term , _modifiers ) do term end end import MySigils ~x(with \#{ &quot;inter&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;polation&quot; } ) #=&gt; &quot;with interpolation&quot; ~x(with \#{ &quot;inter&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;polation&quot; } )r #=&gt; &quot;noitalopretni htiw&quot; ~X(without \#{&quot;interpolation&quot;}) #=&gt; &quot;without \\\#{&quot;interpolation&quot;}&quot; ~X(without \#{&quot;interpolation&quot;})r #=&gt; &quot;}\\&quot;noitalopretni\\&quot;{# tuohtiw&quot;","ref":"Macro.html","source_doc":"Functions for manipulating AST and implementing macros.\n\nMacros are compile-time constructs that receive Elixir's AST as input\nand return Elixir's AST as output.\n\nMany of the functions in this module exist precisely to work with Elixir\nAST, to traverse, query, and transform it.\n\nLet's see a simple example that shows the difference between functions\nand macros:\n\n    defmodule Example do\n      defmacro macro_inspect(value) do\n        IO.inspect(value)\n        value\n      end\n\n      def fun_inspect(value) do\n        IO.inspect(value)\n        value\n      end\n    end\n\nNow let's give it a try:\n\n    import Example\n\n    macro_inspect(1)\n    #=> 1\n    #=> 1\n\n    fun_inspect(1)\n    #=> 1\n    #=> 1\n\nSo far they behave the same, as we are passing an integer as argument.\nBut let's see what happens when we pass an expression:\n\n    macro_inspect(1 + 2)\n    #=> {:+, [line: 3], [1, 2]}\n    #=> 3\n\n    fun_inspect(1 + 2)\n    #=> 3\n    #=> 3\n\nThe macro receives the representation of the code given as argument,\nwhile a function receives the result of the code given as argument.\nA macro must return a superset of the code representation.

Alternatives There are a few suitable alternatives to replace GenEvent. Each of them can be the most beneficial based on the use case. Supervisor and GenServers One alternative to GenEvent is a very minimal solution consisting of using a supervisor and multiple GenServers started under it. The supervisor acts as the &quot;event manager&quot; and the children GenServers act as the &quot;event handlers&quot;. This approach has some shortcomings (it provides no backpressure for example) but can still replace GenEvent for low-profile usages of it. This blog post by Jos칠 Valim has more detailed information on this approach. GenStage If the use case where you were using GenEvent requires more complex logic, GenStage provides a great alternative. GenStage is an external Elixir library maintained by the Elixir team; it provides a tool to implement systems that exchange events in a demand-driven way with built-in support for backpressure.

Each of them can be\nthe most beneficial based on the use case.\n\n### Supervisor and GenServers\n\nOne alternative to GenEvent is a very minimal solution consisting of using a\nsupervisor and multiple GenServers started under it. The supervisor acts as\nthe \"event manager\" and the children GenServers act as the \"event handlers\".\nThis approach has some shortcomings (it provides no backpressure for example)\nbut can still replace GenEvent for low-profile usages of it. [This blog post\nby Jos칠\nValim](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/11/replacing-genevent-by-a-supervisor-genserver/)\nhas more detailed information on this approach.\n\n### GenStage\n\nIf the use case where you were using GenEvent requires more complex logic,\n[GenStage](https://github.com/elixir-lang/gen_stage) provides a great\nalternative. GenStage is an external Elixir library maintained by the Elixir\nteam; it provides a tool to implement systems that exchange events in a\ndemand-driven way with built-in support for backpressure. See the [GenStage\ndocumentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage) for more information.\n\n### `:gen_event`\n\nIf your use case requires exactly what GenEvent provided, or you have to\nintegrate with an existing `:gen_event`-based system, you can still use the\n[`:gen_event`](`:gen_event`) Erlang module.\n","title":"GenEvent","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#c:code_change/3","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.code_change/3","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#c:handle_call/2","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.handle_call/2","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#c:handle_event/2","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.handle_event/2","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#c:handle_info/2","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.handle_info/2","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#c:init/1","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.init/1","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#c:terminate/2","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.terminate/2","type":"callback"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#t:handler/0","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.handler/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#t:manager/0","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.manager/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#t:name/0","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.name/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#t:on_start/0","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.on_start/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"GenEvent.html#t:options/0","source_doc":false,"title":"GenEvent.options/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"Tuple-based HashDict implementation.

In this case the supervisor will only restart if its child specification was defined with the :restart option set to :permanent (the default). Shutdown values ( :shutdown ) The following shutdown values are supported in the :shutdown option: :brutal_kill - the child process is unconditionally terminated using Process.exit(child, :kill) :infinity - if the child process is a supervisor, this is a mechanism to give the subtree enough time to shut down; it can also be used with workers with care a non-negative integer - the amount of time in milliseconds that the supervisor tells the child process to terminate by calling Process.exit(child, :shutdown) and then waits for an exit signal back.

Avoid using exceptions for control-flow You should avoid using exceptions for control-flow. For example, instead of: try do contents = File . read! ( &quot;some_path_that_may_or_may_not_exist&quot; ) { :it_worked , contents } rescue File.Error -&gt; :it_failed end you should prefer: case File . read ( &quot;some_path_that_may_or_may_not_exist&quot; ) do { :ok , contents } -&gt; { :it_worked , contents }  { :error , _ } -&gt; :it_failed end As a library author, it is your responsibility to make sure users are not required to use exceptions for control-flow in their applications. You can follow the same convention as Elixir here, using the name without ! for returning :ok / :error tuples and appending ! for a version of the function which raises an exception. It is important to note that a name without ! does not mean a function will never raise. For example, even File.read/1 can fail in case of bad arguments: iex&gt; File . read ( 1 ) ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in IO.chardata_to_string/1 The usage of :ok / :error tuples is about the domain that the function works on, in this case, file system access. Bad arguments, logical errors, invalid options should raise regardless of the function name. If in doubt, prefer to return tuples instead of raising, as users of your library can always match on the results and raise if necessary. Avoid working with invalid data Elixir programs should prefer to validate data as close to the end user as possible, so the errors are easy to locate and fix. This practice also saves you from writing defensive code in the internals of the library. For example, imagine you have an API that receives a filename as a binary. At some point you will want to write to this file. You could have a function like this: def my_fun ( some_arg , file_to_write_to , options \\\\ [ ] ) do ... some code ... AnotherModuleInLib . invoke_something_that_will_eventually_write_to_file ( file_to_write_to ) ... more code ... end The problem with the code above is that, if the user supplies an invalid input, the error will be raised deep inside the library, which makes it confusing for users. Furthermore, when you don't validate the values at the boundary, the internals of your library are never quite sure which kind of values they are working with. A better function definition would be: def my_fun ( some_arg , file_to_write_to , options \\\\ [ ] ) when is_binary ( file_to_write_to ) do Elixir also leverages pattern matching and guards in function clauses to provide clear error messages in case invalid arguments are given. This advice does not only apply to libraries, but to any Elixir code. Every time you receive multiple options or work with external data, you should validate the data at the boundary and convert it to structured data. For example, if you provide a GenServer that can be started with multiple options, you want to validate those options when the server starts and rely only on structured data throughout the process life cycle. Similarly, if a database or a socket gives you a map of strings, after you receive the data, you should validate it and potentially convert it to a struct or a map of atoms. Avoid application configuration You should avoid using the application environment (see Application.get_env/2 ) as the configuration mechanism for libraries. The application environment is global which means it becomes impossible for two dependencies to use your library in two different ways. Let's see a simple example. Imagine that you implement a library that breaks a string in two parts based on the first occurrence of the dash - character: defmodule DashSplitter do def split ( string ) when is_binary ( string ) do String . split ( string , &quot;-&quot; , parts : 2 ) end end Now imagine someone wants to split the string in three parts. You decide to make the number of parts configurable via the application environment: def split ( string ) when is_binary ( string ) do parts = Application . get_env ( :dash_splitter , :parts , 2 ) String . split ( string , &quot;-&quot; , parts : parts ) end Now users can configure your library in their config/config.exs file as follows: config :dash_splitter , :parts , 3 Once your library is configured, it will change the behaviour of all users of your library. If a library was expecting it to split the string in 2 parts, since the configuration is global, it will now split it in 3 parts. The solution is to provide configuration as close as possible to where it is used and not via the application environment. In case of a function, you could expect keyword lists as a new argument: def split ( string , opts \\\\ [ ] ) when is_binary ( string ) and is_list ( opts ) do parts = Keyword . get ( opts , :parts , 2 ) String . split ( string , &quot;-&quot; , parts : parts ) end In case you need to configure a process, the options should be passed when starting that process. The application environment should be reserved only for configurations that are truly global, for example, to control your application boot process and its supervision tree. And, generally speaking, it is best to avoid global configuration. If you must use configuration, then prefer runtime configuration instead of compile-time configuration. See the Application module for more information. For all remaining scenarios, libraries should not force their users to use the application environment for configuration. If the user of a library believes that certain parameter should be configured globally, then they can wrap the library functionality with their own application environment configuration. Avoid defining modules that are not in your &quot;namespace&quot; Even though Elixir does not formally have the concept of namespaces, a library should use its name as a &quot;prefix&quot; for all of its modules (except for special cases like mix tasks). For example, if the library's OTP application name is :my_lib , then all of its modules should start with the MyLib prefix, for example MyLib.User , MyLib.SubModule , and MyLib.Application . This is important because the Erlang VM can only load one instance of a module at a time. So if there are multiple libraries that define the same module, then they are incompatible with each other due to this limitation. By always using the library name as a prefix, it avoids module name clashes due to the unique prefix. Furthermore, when writing a library that is an extension of another library, you should avoid defining modules inside the parent's library namespace. For example, if you are writing a package that adds authentication to Plug called plug_auth , its modules should be namespaced under PlugAuth instead of Plug.Auth , so it avoids conflicts with Plug if it were to ever define its own authentication functionality. Avoid use when an import is enough A library should not provide use MyLib functionality if all use MyLib does is to import / alias the module itself. For example, this is an anti-pattern: defmodule MyLib do defmacro __using__ ( _ ) do quote do import MyLib end end def some_fun ( arg1 , arg2 ) do ... end end The reason why defining the __using__ macro above should be avoided is because when a developer writes: defmodule MyApp do use MyLib end It allows use MyLib to run any code into the MyApp module. For someone reading the code, it is impossible to assess the impact that use MyLib has in a module without looking at the implementation of __using__ . The following code is clearer: defmodule MyApp do import MyLib end The code above says we are only bringing in the functions from MyLib so we can invoke some_fun(arg1, arg2) directly without the MyLib. prefix. Even more important, import MyLib says that we have an option to not import MyLib at all as we can simply invoke the function as MyLib.some_fun(arg1, arg2) . If the module you want to invoke a function on has a long name, such as SomeLibrary.Namespace.MyLib , and you find it verbose, you can leverage the alias/2 special form and still refer to the module as MyLib . While there are situations where use SomeModule is necessary, use should be skipped when all it does is to import or alias other modules. In a nutshell, alias should be preferred, as it is simpler and clearer than import , while import is simpler and clearer than use . Avoid macros Although the previous section could be summarized as &quot;avoid macros&quot;, both topics are important enough to deserve their own sections. To quote the official guide on macros : Even though Elixir attempts its best to provide a safe environment for macros, the major responsibility of writing clean code with macros falls on developers. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Elixir functions and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. So write macros responsibly. Elixir already provides mechanisms to write your everyday code in a simple and readable fashion by using its data structures and functions. Macros should only be used as a last resort. Remember that explicit is better than implicit . Clear code is better than concise code . When you absolutely have to use a macro, make sure that a macro is not the only way the user can interface with your library and keep the amount of code generated by a macro to a minimum. For example, the Logger module provides Logger.debug/2 , Logger.info/2 and friends as macros that are capable of extracting environment information, but a low-level mechanism for logging is still available with Logger.bare_log/3 . Avoid using processes for code organization A developer must never use a process for code organization purposes. A process must be used to model runtime properties such as: Mutable state and access to shared resources (such as ETS, files, and others) Concurrency and distribution Initialization, shutdown and restart logic (as seen in supervisors) System messages such as timer messages and monitoring events In Elixir, code organization is done by modules and functions, processes are not necessary. For example, imagine you are implementing a calculator and you decide to put all the calculator operations behind a GenServer : def add ( a , b ) do GenServer . call ( __MODULE__ , { :add , a , b } ) end def handle_call ( { :add , a , b } , _from , state ) do { :reply , a + b , state } end def handle_call ( { :subtract , a , b } , _from , state ) do { :reply , a - b , state } end This is an anti-pattern not only because it convolutes the calculator logic but also because you put the calculator logic behind a single process that will potentially become a bottleneck in your system, especially as the number of calls grow. Instead, just define the functions directly: def add ( a , b ) do a + b end def subtract ( a , b ) do a - b end Use processes only to model runtime properties, never for code organization. And even when you think something could be done in parallel with processes, often it is best to let the callers of your library decide how to parallelize, rather than impose a certain execution flow in users of your code. Avoid spawning unsupervised processes You should avoid spawning processes outside of a supervision tree, especially long-running ones. Instead, processes must be started inside supervision trees. This guarantees developers have full control over the initialization, restarts, and shutdown of the system. If your application does not have a supervision tree, one can be added by changing def application inside mix.exs to include a :mod key with the application callback name: def application do [ extra_applications : [ :logger ] , mod : { MyApp.Application , [ ] } ] end and then defining a my_app/application.ex file with the following template: defmodule MyApp.Application do # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html # for more information on OTP Applications @moduledoc false use Application def start ( _type , _args ) do children = [ # Starts a worker by calling: MyApp.Worker.start_link(arg) # {MyApp.Worker, arg} ] # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html # for other strategies and supported options opts = [ strategy : :one_for_one , name : MyApp.Supervisor ] Supervisor . start_link ( children , opts ) end end This is the same template generated by mix new --sup . Each process started with the application must be listed as a child under the Supervisor above. We call those &quot;static processes&quot; because they are known upfront. For handling dynamic processes, such as the ones started during requests and other user inputs, look at the DynamicSupervisor module. One of the few times where it is acceptable to start a process outside of a supervision tree is with Task.async/1 and Task.await/2 . Opposite to Task.start_link/1 , the async/await mechanism gives you full control over the spawned process life cycle - which is also why you must always call Task.await/2 after starting a task with Task.async/1 . Even though, if your application is spawning multiple async processes, you should consider using Task.Supervisor for better visibility when instrumenting and monitoring the system.","ref":"library-guidelines.html#anti-patterns","source_doc":"When your library is published and used as a dependency, its [lockfile](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Project.html#module-configuration) (usually named `mix.lock`) is _ignored by the host project_.

These versions might be greater than those stored in your `mix.lock` (and hence used in your tests / CI).\n\nOn the other hand, contributors of your library, need a deterministic build, which implies the presence of `mix.lock` in your Version Control System (VCS).\n\nThe best practice of handling `mix.lock` file therefore would be to keep it in VCS, and run two different Continuous Integration (CI) workflows: the usual deterministic one, and another one, that starts with `mix deps.unlock --all` and always compiles your library and runs tests against latest versions of dependencies. The latter one might be even run nightly or otherwise recurrently to stay notified about any possible issue in regard to dependencies updates.","title":"Library Guidelines - Anti-patterns","type":"extras"},{"doc":"This document is an overview of the naming conventions in Elixir, from casing to punctuation characters.

They can be hard to read and even more to understand, as they don't have a descriptive name like functions do. That said, some specific cases or custom domain specific languages (DSLs) may justify these practices. It is also possible to replace predefined operators, such as + , but doing so is extremely discouraged.","ref":"operators.html#custom-and-overridden-operators","source_doc":"#","title":"Operators - Custom and overridden operators","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Elixir provides pattern matching, which allows us to assert on the shape or extract values from data structures.

One of the most used constructs to perform pattern matching is the match operator ( = ): iex&gt; x = 1 1 iex&gt; 1 = x 1 In the example above, x starts without a value and has 1 assigned to it. Then, we compare the value of x to the literal 1 , which succeeds as they are both 1 . Matching x against 2 would raise: iex&gt; 2 = x ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1 Patterns are not bidirectional. If you have a variable y that was never assigned to (often called an unbound variable) and you write 1 = y , an error will be raised: iex&gt; 1 = y ** (CompileError) iex:2: undefined variable &quot;y&quot; In other words, patterns are allowed only on the left side of = . The right side of = follows the regular evaluation semantics of the language. Now let's cover the pattern matching rules for each construct and then for each relevant data types. Variables Variables in patterns are always assigned to: iex&gt; x = 1 1 iex&gt; x = 2 2 iex&gt; x 2 In other words, Elixir supports rebinding. In case you don't want the value of a variable to change, you can use the pin operator ( ^ ): iex&gt; x = 1 1 iex&gt; ^ x = 2 ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2 If the same variable appears twice in the same pattern, then they must be bound to the same value: iex&gt; { x , x } = { 1 , 1 } { 1 , 1 } iex&gt; { x , x } = { 1 , 2 } ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {1, 2} The underscore variable ( _ ) has a special meaning as it can never be bound to any value. It is especially useful when you don't care about certain value in a pattern: iex&gt; { _ , integer } = { :not_important , 1 } { :not_important , 1 } iex&gt; integer 1 iex&gt; _ ** (CompileError) iex:3: invalid use of _ Literals (numbers and atoms) Atoms and numbers (integers and floats) can appear in patterns and they are always represented as is. For example, an atom will only match an atom if they are the same atom: iex&gt; :atom = :atom :atom iex&gt; :atom = :another_atom ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: :another_atom Similar rule applies to numbers. Finally, note that numbers in patterns perform strict comparison. In other words, integers to do not match floats: iex&gt; 1 = 1.0 ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1.0 Tuples Tuples may appear in patterns using the curly brackets syntax ( {} ). A tuple in a pattern will match only tuples of the same size, where each individual tuple element must also match: iex&gt; { :ok , integer } = { :ok , 13 } { :ok , 13 } # won&#39;t match due to different size iex&gt; { :ok , integer } = { :ok , 11 , 13 } ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:ok, 11, 13} # won&#39;t match due to mismatch on first element iex&gt; { :ok , binary } = { :error , :enoent } ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, :enoent} Lists Lists may appear in patterns using the square brackets syntax ( [] ). A list in a pattern will match only lists of the same size, where each individual list element must also match: iex&gt; [ :ok , integer ] = [ :ok , 13 ] [ :ok , 13 ] # won&#39;t match due to different size iex&gt; [ :ok , integer ] = [ :ok , 11 , 13 ] ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [:ok, 11, 13] # won&#39;t match due to mismatch on first element iex&gt; [ :ok , binary ] = [ :error , :enoent ] ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [:error, :enoent] Opposite to tuples, lists also allow matching on non-empty lists by using the [head | tail] notation, which matches on the head and tail of a list: iex&gt; [ head | tail ] = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] iex&gt; head 1 iex&gt; tail [ 2 , 3 ] Multiple elements may prefix the | tail construct: iex&gt; [ first , second | tail ] = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] iex&gt; tail [ 3 ] Note [head | tail] does not match empty lists: iex&gt; [ head | tail ] = [ ] ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [] Given charlists are represented as a list of integers, one can also perform prefix matches on charlists using the list concatenation operator ( ++ ): iex&gt; &#39;hello &#39; ++ world = &#39;hello world&#39; &#39;hello world&#39; iex&gt; world &#39;world&#39; Which is equivalent to matching on [?h, ?e, ?l, ?l, ?o, ?\\s | world] . Suffix matches ( hello ++ ' world' ) are not valid patterns. Maps Maps may appear in patterns using the percentage sign followed by the curly brackets syntax ( %{} ). Opposite to lists and tuples, maps perform a subset match. This means a map pattern will match any other map that has at least all of the keys in the pattern. Here is an example where all keys match: iex&gt; %{ name : name } = %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; } %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; } iex&gt; name &quot;meg&quot; Here is when a subset of the keys match: iex&gt; %{ name : name } = %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; , age : 23 } %{ age : 23 , name : &quot;meg&quot; } iex&gt; name &quot;meg&quot; If a key in the pattern is not available in the map, then they won't match: iex&gt; %{ name : name , age : age } = %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; } ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: %{name: &quot;meg&quot;} Note that the empty map will match all maps, which is a contrast to tuples and lists, where an empty tuple or an empty list will only match empty tuples and empty lists respectively: iex&gt; %{ } = %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; } %{ name : &quot;meg&quot; } Finally, note map keys in patterns must always be literals or previously bound variables matched with the pin operator. Structs Structs may appear in patterns using the percentage sign, the struct module name or a variable followed by the curly brackets syntax ( %{} ). Given the following struct: defmodule User do defstruct [ :name ] end Here is an example where all keys match: iex&gt; % User { name : name } = % User { name : &quot;meg&quot; } % User { name : &quot;meg&quot; } iex&gt; name &quot;meg&quot; If an unknown key is given, the compiler will raise an error: iex&gt; % User { type : type } = % User { name : &quot;meg&quot; } ** (CompileError) iex: unknown key :type for struct User The struct name can be extracted when putting a variable instead of a module name: iex&gt; % struct_name { } = % User { name : &quot;meg&quot; } % User { name : &quot;meg&quot; } iex&gt; struct_name User Binaries Binaries may appear in patterns using the double less-than/greater-than syntax ( &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; ). A binary in a pattern can match multiple segments at the same time, each with different type, size, and unit: iex&gt; &lt;&lt; val :: unit ( 8 ) - size ( 2 ) - integer &gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt; 123 , 56 &gt;&gt; &quot;{8&quot; iex&gt; val 31544 See the documentation for &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; for a complete definition of pattern matching for binaries. Finally, remember that strings in Elixir are UTF-8 encoded binaries. This means that, similar to charlists, prefix matches on strings are also possible with the binary concatenation operator ( &lt;&gt; ): iex&gt; &quot;hello &quot; &lt;&gt; world = &quot;hello world&quot; &quot;hello world&quot; iex&gt; world &quot;world&quot; Suffix matches ( hello &lt;&gt; &quot; world&quot; ) are not valid patterns.","ref":"patterns-and-guards.html#patterns","source_doc":"Patterns in Elixir are made of variables, literals, and data structure specific syntax.

They are allowed in a predefined set of constructs where pattern matching is allowed, such as function definitions, case clauses, and others. Not all expressions are allowed in guard clauses, but only a handful of them. This is a deliberate choice. This way, Elixir (and Erlang) can make sure that nothing bad happens while executing guards and no mutations happen anywhere. It also allows the compiler to optimize the code related to guards efficiently. List of allowed functions and operators You can find the built-in list of guards in the Kernel module . Here is an overview: comparison operators ( == , != , === , !== , &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ) strictly boolean operators ( and , or , not ). Note &amp;&amp; , || , and ! sibling operators are not allowed as they're not strictly boolean - meaning they don't require arguments to be booleans arithmetic unary operators ( + , - ) arithmetic binary operators + , - , * , / ) in and not in operators (as long as the right-hand side is a list or a range) &quot;type-check&quot; functions ( is_list/1 , is_number/1 , and the like) functions that work on built-in datatypes ( abs/1 , hd/1 , map_size/1 , and others) the map.field syntax The module Bitwise also includes a handful of Erlang bitwise operations as guards . Macros constructed out of any combination of the above guards are also valid guards - for example, Integer.is_even/1 . For more information, see the &quot;Custom patterns and guards expressions&quot; section shown below. Why guards Let's see an example of a guard used in a function clause: def empty_map? ( map ) when map_size ( map ) == 0 , do : true def empty_map? ( map ) when is_map ( map ) , do : false Guards start with the when operator, followed by a guard expression. The clause will be executed if and only if the guard expression returns true . Multiple boolean conditions can be combined with the and and or operators. Writing the empty_map?/1 function by only using pattern matching would not be possible (as pattern matching on %{} would match any map, not only the empty ones). Failing guards A function clause will be executed if and only if its guard expression evaluates to true . If any other value is returned, the function clause will be skipped. In particular, guards have no concept of &quot;truthy&quot; or &quot;falsy&quot;. For example, imagine a function that checks that the head of a list is not nil : def not_nil_head? ( [ head | _ ] ) when head , do : true def not_nil_head? ( _ ) , do : false not_nil_head? ( [ &quot;some_value&quot; , &quot;another_value&quot; ] ) #=&gt; false Even though the head of the list is not nil , the first clause for not_nil_head?/1 fails because the expression does not evaluate to true , but to &quot;some_value&quot; , therefore triggering the second clause which returns false . To make the guard behave correctly, you must ensure that the guard evaluates to true , like so: def not_nil_head? ( [ head | _ ] ) when head != nil , do : true def not_nil_head? ( _ ) , do : false not_nil_head? ( [ &quot;some_value&quot; , &quot;another_value&quot; ] ) #=&gt; true Errors in guards In guards, when functions would normally raise exceptions, they cause the guard to fail instead. For example, the tuple_size/1 function only works with tuples. If we use it with anything else, an argument error is raised: iex&gt; tuple_size ( &quot;hello&quot; ) ** (ArgumentError) argument error However, when used in guards, the corresponding clause will fail to match instead of raising an error: iex&gt; case &quot;hello&quot; do ...&gt; something when tuple_size ( something ) == 2 -&gt; ...&gt; :worked ...&gt; _anything_else -&gt; ...&gt; :failed ...&gt; end :failed In many cases, we can take advantage of this. In the code above, we used tuple_size/1 to both check that the given value is a tuple and check its size (instead of using is_tuple(something) and tuple_size(something) == 2 ). However, if your guard has multiple conditions, such as checking for tuples or maps, it is best to call type-check functions like is_tuple/1 before tuple_size/1 , otherwise the whole guard will fail if a tuple is not given. Alternatively, your function clause can use multiple guards as shown in the following section. Multiple guards in the same clause There exists an additional way to simplify a chain of or expressions in guards: Elixir supports writing &quot;multiple guards&quot; in the same clause. The following code: def is_number_or_nil ( term ) when is_integer ( term ) or is_float ( term ) or is_nil ( term ) , do : :maybe_number def is_number_or_nil ( _other ) , do : :something_else can be alternatively written as: def is_number_or_nil ( term ) when is_integer ( term ) when is_float ( term ) when is_nil ( term ) do :maybe_number end def is_number_or_nil ( _other ) do :something_else end If each guard expression always returns a boolean, the two forms are equivalent. However, recall that if any function call in a guard raises an exception, the entire guard fails. To illustrate this, the following function will not detect empty tuples: defmodule Check do # If given a tuple, map_size/1 will raise, and tuple_size/1 will not be evaluated def empty? ( val ) when map_size ( val ) == 0 or tuple_size ( val ) == 0 , do : true def empty? ( _val ) , do : false end Check . empty? ( %{ } ) #=&gt; true Check . empty? ( { } ) #=&gt; false # true was expected! This could be corrected by ensuring that no exception is raised, either via type checks like is_map(val) and map_size(val) == 0 , or by using multiple guards, so that if an exception causes one guard to fail, the next one is evaluated. defmodule Check do # If given a tuple, map_size/1 will raise, and the second guard will be evaluated def empty? ( val ) when map_size ( val ) == 0 when tuple_size ( val ) == 0 , do : true def empty? ( _val ) , do : false end Check . empty? ( %{ } ) #=&gt; true Check . empty? ( { } ) #=&gt; true","ref":"patterns-and-guards.html#guards","source_doc":"Variables in patterns are always assigned to:\n\n```iex\niex> x = 1\n1\niex> x = 2\n2\niex> x\n2\n```\n\nIn other words, Elixir supports rebinding.

However, we can take advantage of macros to write custom patterns guards that can simplify our programs or make them more domain-specific. At the end of the day, what matters is that the output of the macros boils down to a combination of the constructs above. For example, the Record module in Elixir provides a series of macros to be used in patterns and guards that allows tuples to have named fields during compilation. For defining your own guards, Elixir even provides conveniences in defguard and defguardp . Let's look at a quick case study: we want to check whether an argument is an even or an odd integer. With pattern matching this is impossible because there is an infinite number of integers, and therefore we can't pattern match on every single one of them. Therefore we must use guards. We will just focus on checking for even numbers since checking for the odd ones is almost identical. Such a guard would look like this: def my_function ( number ) when is_integer ( number ) and rem ( number , 2 ) == 0 do # do stuff end It would be repetitive to write every time we need this check. Instead, you can use defguard/1 and defguardp/1 to create guard macros. Here's an example how: defmodule MyInteger do defguard is_even ( term ) when is_integer ( term ) and rem ( term , 2 ) == 0 end and then: import MyInteger , only : [ is_even : 1 ] def my_function ( number ) when is_even ( number ) do # do stuff end While it's possible to create custom guards with macros, it's recommended to define them using defguard/1 and defguardp/1 which perform additional compile-time checks.","ref":"patterns-and-guards.html#custom-patterns-and-guards-expressions","source_doc":"Tuples may appear in patterns using the curly brackets syntax (`{}`).

Integers never contain a dot ( . ) in their representation. Floats contain a dot and at least one other digit after the dot. Floats also support the scientific notation, such as 123.4e10 or 123.4E10 . Atoms Unquoted atoms start with a colon ( : ) which must be immediately followed by a Unicode letter or an underscore. The atom may continue using a sequence of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, and @ . Atoms may end in ! or ? . Valid unquoted atoms are: :ok , :ISO8601 , and :integer? . If the colon is immediately followed by a pair of double- or single-quotes surrounding the atom name, the atom is considered quoted. In contrast with an unquoted atom, this one can be made of any Unicode character (not only letters), such as :'游꺅 Elixir' , :&quot;++ol치++&quot; , and :&quot;123&quot; . Quoted and unquoted atoms with the same name are considered equivalent, so :atom , :&quot;atom&quot; , and :'atom' represent the same atom. The only catch is that the compiler will warn when quotes are used in atoms that do not need to be quoted. All operators in Elixir are also valid atoms. Valid examples are :foo , :FOO , :foo_42 , :foo@bar , and :++ . Invalid examples are :@foo ( @ is not allowed at start), :123 (numbers are not allowed at start), and :(*) (not a valid operator). true , false , and nil are reserved words that are represented by the atoms :true , :false and :nil respectively. To learn more about all Unicode characters allowed in atom, see the Unicode syntax document. Strings Single-line strings in Elixir are written between double-quotes, such as &quot;foo&quot; . Any double-quote inside the string must be escaped with \\ . Strings support Unicode characters and are stored as UTF-8 encoded binaries. Multi-line strings in Elixir are written with three double-quotes, and can have unescaped quotes within them. The resulting string will end with a newline. The indentation of the last &quot;&quot;&quot; is used to strip indentation from the inner string. For example: iex&gt; test = &quot;&quot;&quot; ...&gt; this ...&gt; is ...&gt; a ...&gt; test ...&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot; this \\n is \\n a \\n test \\n &quot; iex&gt; test = &quot;&quot;&quot; ...&gt; This ...&gt; Is ...&gt; A ...&gt; Test ...&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;This \\n Is \\n A \\n Test \\n &quot; Strings are always represented as themselves in the AST. Charlists Charlists in Elixir are written in single-quotes, such as 'foo' . Any single-quote inside the string must be escaped with \\ . Charlists are made of non-negative integers, where each integer represents a Unicode code point. Multi-line charlists are written with three single-quotes ( ''' ), the same way multi-line strings are. Charlists are always represented as themselves in the AST. For more in-depth information, please read the &quot;Charlists&quot; section in the List module. Lists, tuples and binaries Data structures such as lists, tuples, and binaries are marked respectively by the delimiters [...] , {...} , and &lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt; . Each element is separated by comma. A trailing comma is also allowed, such as in [1, 2, 3,] . Maps and keyword lists Maps use the %{...} notation and each key-value is given by pairs marked with =&gt; , such as %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; 1, 2 =&gt; &quot;world&quot;} . Both keyword lists (list of two-element tuples where the first element is atom) and maps with atom keys support a keyword notation where the colon character : is moved to the end of the atom. %{hello: &quot;world&quot;} is equivalent to %{:hello =&gt; &quot;world&quot;} and [foo: :bar] is equivalent to [{:foo, :bar}] . This notation is a syntax sugar that emits the same AST representation. It will be explained in later sections. Structs Structs built on the map syntax by passing the struct name between % and { .

The variable may continue using a sequence of Unicode letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables may end in ? or ! . To learn more about all Unicode characters allowed in variables, see the Unicode syntax document. Elixir's naming conventions recommend variables to be in snake_case format. Non-qualified calls (local calls) Non-qualified calls, such as add(1, 2) , must start with characters and then follow the same rules as as variables, which are optionally followed by parentheses, and then arguments. Parentheses are required for zero-arity calls (i.e. calls without arguments), to avoid ambiguity with variables. If parentheses are used, they must immediately follow the function name without spaces . For example, add (1, 2) is a syntax error, since (1, 2) is treated as an invalid block which is attempted to be given as a single argument to add . Elixir's naming conventions recommend calls to be in snake_case format. Operators As many programming languages, Elixir also support operators as non-qualified calls with their precedence and associativity rules. Constructs such as = , when , &amp; and @ are simply treated as operators. See the Operators page for a full reference. Qualified calls (remote calls) Qualified calls, such as Math.add(1, 2) , must start with characters and then follow the same rules as as variables, which are optionally followed by parentheses, and then arguments. Qualified calls also support operators, such as Kernel.+(1, 2) . Elixir also allows the function name to be written between double- or single-quotes, allowing any character in between the quotes, such as Math.&quot;++add++&quot;(1, 2) . Similar to non-qualified calls, parentheses have different meaning for zero-arity calls (i.e. calls without arguments). If parentheses are used, such as mod.fun() , it means a function call. If parenthesis are skipped, such as map.field , it means accessing a field of a map. Elixir's naming conventions recommend calls to be in snake_case format. Aliases Aliases are constructs that expand to atoms at compile-time. The alias String expands to the atom :&quot;Elixir.String&quot; . Aliases must start with an ASCII uppercase character which may be followed by any ASCII letter, number, or underscore. Non-ASCII characters are not supported in aliases. Multiple aliases can be joined with . , such as MyApp.String , and it expands to the atom :&quot;Elixir.MyApp.String&quot; . The dot is effectively part of the name but it can also be used for composition. If you define alias MyApp.Example, as: Example in your code, then Example will always expand to :&quot;Elixir.MyApp.Example&quot; and Example.String will expand to :&quot;Elixir.MyApp.Example.String&quot; . Elixir's naming conventions recommend aliases to be in CamelCase format. Module attributes Module attributes are module-specific storage and are written as the composition of the unary operator @ with variables and local calls. For example, to write to a module attribute named foo , use @foo &quot;value&quot; , and use @foo to read from it. Given module attributes are written using existing constructs, they follow the same rules above defined for operators, variables, and local calls. Blocks Blocks are multiple Elixir expressions separated by newlines or semi-colons. A new block may be created at any moment by using parentheses. Left to right arrow The left to right arrow ( -&gt; ) is used to establish a relationship between left and right, commonly referred as clauses. The left side may have zero, one, or more arguments; the right side is zero, one, or more expressions separated by new line. The -&gt; may appear one or more times between one of the following terminators: do - end , fn - end or ( - ) . When -&gt; is used, only other clauses are allowed between those terminators. Mixing clauses and regular expressions is invalid syntax. It is seen on case and cond constructs between do and end : case 1 do 2 -&gt; 3 4 -&gt; 5 end cond do true -&gt; false end Seen in typespecs between ( and ) : ( integer ( ) , boolean ( ) -&gt; integer ( ) ) It is also used between fn and end for building anonymous functions: fn x , y -&gt; x + y end Sigils Sigils start with ~ and are followed by one lowercase letter or by one or more uppercase letters, immediatelly followed by one of the following pairs: ( and ) { and } [ and ] &lt; and &gt; &quot; and &quot; ' and ' | and | / and / After closing the pair, zero or more ASCII letters and digits can be given as a modifier. Sigils are expressed as non-qualified calls prefixed with sigil_ where the first argument is the sigil contents as a string and the second argument is a list of integers as modifiers: If the sigil letter is in uppercase, no interpolation is allowed in the sigil, otherwise its contents may be dynamic. Compare the results of the sigils below for more information: ~s/f \#{ &quot;o&quot; } o/ ~S/f\#{&quot;o&quot;}o/ Sigils are useful to encode text with their own escaping rules, such as regular expressions, datetimes, and others.","ref":"syntax-reference.html#expressions","source_doc":"Integers (`1234`) and floats (`123.4`) in Elixir are represented as a sequence of digits that may be separated by underscore for readability purposes, such as `1_000_000`.

Elixir's AST is a regular Elixir data structure composed of the following elements: atoms - such as :foo integers - such as 42 floats - such as 13.1 strings - such as &quot;hello&quot; lists - such as [1, 2, 3] tuples with two elements - such as {&quot;hello&quot;, :world} tuples with three elements, representing calls or variables, as explained next The building block of Elixir's AST is a call, such as: sum ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) which is represented as a tuple with three elements: { :sum , meta , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] } the first element is an atom (or another tuple), the second element is a list of two-element tuples with metadata (such as line numbers) and the third is a list of arguments. We can retrieve the AST for any Elixir expression by calling quote : quote do sum ( ) end #=&gt; {:sum, [], []} Variables are also represented using a tuple with three elements and a combination of lists and atoms, for example: quote do sum end #=&gt; {:sum, [], Elixir} You can see that variables are also represented with a tuple, except the third element is an atom expressing the variable context. Over the course of this section, we will explore many Elixir syntax constructs alongside their AST representations. Operators Operators are treated as non-qualified calls: quote do 1 + 2 end #=&gt; {:+, [], [1, 2]} Note that . is also an operator. Remote calls use the dot in the AST with two arguments, where the second argument is always an atom: quote do foo . bar ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) end #=&gt; {{:., [], [{:foo, [], Elixir}, :bar]}, [], [1, 2, 3]} Calling anonymous functions uses the dot in the AST with a single argument, mirroring the fact the function name is &quot;missing&quot; from right side of the dot: quote do foo . ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) end #=&gt; {{:., [], [{:foo, [], Elixir}]}, [], [1, 2, 3]} Aliases Aliases are represented by an __aliases__ call with each segment separated by a dot as an argument: quote do Foo.Bar.Baz end #=&gt; {:__aliases__, [], [:Foo, :Bar, :Baz]} quote do __MODULE__ . Bar.Baz end #=&gt; {:__aliases__, [], [{:__MODULE__, [], Elixir}, :Bar, :Baz]} All arguments, except the first, are guaranteed to be atoms. Data structures Remember that lists are literals, so they are represented as themselves in the AST: quote do [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] end #=&gt; [1, 2, 3] Tuples have their own representation, except for two-element tuples, which are represented as themselves: quote do { 1 , 2 } end #=&gt; {1, 2} quote do { 1 , 2 , 3 } end #=&gt; {:{}, [], [1, 2, 3]} Binaries have a representation similar to tuples, except they are tagged with :&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; instead of :{} : quote do &lt;&lt; 1 , 2 , 3 &gt;&gt; end #=&gt; {:&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;, [], [1, 2, 3]} The same applies to maps, where each pair is treated as a list of tuples with two elements: quote do %{ 1 =&gt; 2 , 3 =&gt; 4 } end #=&gt; {:%{}, [], [{1, 2}, {3, 4}]} Blocks Blocks are represented as a __block__ call with each line as a separate argument: quote do 1 2 3 end #=&gt; {:__block__, [], [1, 2, 3]} quote do 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; end #=&gt; {:__block__, [], [1, 2, 3]} Left to right arrow The left to right arrow ( -&gt; ) is represented similar to operators except that they are always part of a list, its left side represents a list of arguments and the right side is an expression. For example, in case and cond : quote do case 1 do 2 -&gt; 3 4 -&gt; 5 end end #=&gt; {:case, [], [1, [do: [{:-&gt;, [], [[2], 3]}, {:-&gt;, [], [[4], 5]}]]]} quote do cond do true -&gt; false end end #=&gt; {:cond, [], [[do: [{:-&gt;, [], [[true], false]}]]]} Between ( and ) : quote do ( 1 , 2 -&gt; 3 4 , 5 -&gt; 6 ) end #=&gt; [{:-&gt;, [], [[1, 2], 3]}, {:-&gt;, [], [[4, 5], 6]}] Between fn and end : quote do fn 1 , 2 -&gt; 3 4 , 5 -&gt; 6 end end #=&gt; {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[1, 2], 3]}, {:-&gt;, [], [[4, 5], 6]}]} Qualified tuples Qualified tuples ( foo.{bar, baz} ) are represented by a {:., [], [expr, :{}]} call, where the expr represents the left hand side of the dot, and the arguments represent the elements inside the curly braces. This is used in Elixir to provide multi aliases: quote do Foo . { Bar , Baz } end #=&gt; {{:., [], [{:__aliases__, [], [:Foo]}, :{}]}, [], [{:__aliases__, [], [:Bar]}, {:__aliases__, [], [:Baz]}]}","ref":"syntax-reference.html#the-elixir-ast","source_doc":"Unquoted atoms start with a colon (`:`) which must be immediately followed by a Unicode letter or an underscore.

Valid unquoted atoms are: `:ok`, `:ISO8601`, and `:integer?`.\n\nIf the colon is immediately followed by a pair of double- or single-quotes surrounding the atom name, the atom is considered quoted. In contrast with an unquoted atom, this one can be made of any Unicode character (not only letters), such as `:'游꺅 Elixir'`, `:\"++ol치++\"`, and `:\"123\"`.\n\nQuoted and unquoted atoms with the same name are considered equivalent, so `:atom`, `:\"atom\"`, and `:'atom'` represent the same atom.

Valid examples are `:foo`, `:FOO`, `:foo_42`, `:foo@bar`, and `:++`.

This section will discuss the remaining constructs that are alternative representations of the constructs above. In other words, the constructs below can be represented in more than one way in your Elixir code and retain AST equivalence. We call this &quot;Optional Syntax&quot;. For a lightweight introduction to Elixir's Optional Syntax, see this document . Below we continue with a more complete reference. Integers in other bases and Unicode code points Elixir allows integers to contain _ to separate digits and provides conveniences to represent integers in other bases: 1_000_000 #=&gt; 1000000 0xABCD #=&gt; 43981 (Hexadecimal base) 0o01234567 #=&gt; 342391 (Octal base) 0b10101010 #=&gt; 170 (Binary base) ?칠 #=&gt; 233 (Unicode code point) Those constructs exist only at the syntax level. All of the examples above are represented as their underlying integers in the AST. Access syntax The access syntax is represented as a call to Access.get/2 : quote do opts [ arg ] end #=&gt; {{:., [], [Access, :get]}, [], [{:opts, [], Elixir}, {:arg, [], Elixir}]} Optional parentheses Elixir provides optional parentheses: quote do sum 1 , 2 , 3 end #=&gt; {:sum, [], [1, 2, 3]} The above is treated the same as sum(1, 2, 3) by the parser. You can remove the parentheses on all calls with at least one argument. You can also skip parentheses on qualified calls, such as Foo.bar 1, 2, 3 . Parentheses are required when invoking anonymous functions, such as f.(1, 2, 3) . In practice, developers prefer to add parentheses to most of their calls. They are skipped mainly in Elixir's control-flow constructs, such as defmodule , if , case , etc, and in certain DSLs. Keywords Keywords in Elixir are a list of tuples of two elements, where the first element is an atom. Using the base constructs, they would be represented as: [ { :foo , 1 } , { :bar , 2 } ] However, Elixir introduces a syntax sugar where the keywords above may be written as follows: [ foo : 1 , bar : 2 ] Atoms with foreign characters, such as whitespace, must be wrapped in quotes. This rule applies to keywords as well: [ { :&quot;foo bar&quot; , 1 } , { :&quot;bar baz&quot; , 2 } ] == [ &quot;foo bar&quot; : 1 , &quot;bar baz&quot; : 2 ] Remember that, because lists and two-element tuples are quoted literals, by definition keywords are also literals (in fact, the only reason tuples with two elements are quoted literals is to support keywords as literals). Keywords as last arguments Elixir also supports a syntax where if the last argument of a call is a keyword list then the square brackets can be skipped. This means that the following: if ( condition , do : this , else : that ) is the same as if ( condition , [ do : this , else : that ] ) which in turn is the same as if ( condition , [ { :do , this } , { :else , that } ] ) do - end blocks The last syntax convenience are do - end blocks. do - end blocks are equivalent to keywords as the last argument of a function call, where the block contents are wrapped in parentheses. For example: if true do this else that end is the same as: if ( true , do : ( this ) , else : ( that ) ) which we have explored in the previous section. Parentheses are important to support multiple expressions. This: if true do this that end is the same as: if ( true , do : ( this that ) ) Inside do - end blocks you may introduce other keywords, such as else used in the if above. The supported keywords between do - end are static and are: after catch else rescue You can see them being used in constructs such as receive , try , and others.","ref":"syntax-reference.html#optional-syntax","source_doc":"Single-line strings in Elixir are written between double-quotes, such as `\"foo\"`.

Strings support Unicode characters and are stored as UTF-8 encoded binaries.\n\nMulti-line strings in Elixir are written with three double-quotes, and can have unescaped quotes within them. The resulting string will end with a newline. The indentation of the last `\"\"\"` is used to strip indentation from the inner string. For example:\n\n```\niex> test = \"\"\"\n...>     this\n...>     is\n...>     a\n...>     test\n...> \"\"\"\n\"    this\\n    is\\n    a\\n    test\\n\"\niex> test = \"\"\"\n...>     This\n...>     Is\n...>     A\n...>     Test\n...>     \"\"\"\n\"This\\nIs\\nA\\nTest\\n\"\n```\n\nStrings are always represented as themselves in the AST.\n\n#","title":"Syntax reference - Optional syntax","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Elixir comes with a notation for declaring types and specifications.

For example, Enum.filter/2 has the following specification: filter(t, (element -&gt; as_boolean(term))) :: list . Remote types Any module is also able to define its own types and the modules in Elixir are no exception. For example, the Range module defines a t/0 type that represents a range: this type can be referred to as Range.t/0 . In a similar fashion, a string is String.t/0 , and so on. Maps The key types in maps are allowed to overlap, and if they do, the leftmost key takes precedence. A map value does not belong to this type if it contains a key that is not in the allowed map keys. If you want to denote that keys that were not previously defined in the map are allowed, it is common to end a map type with optional(any) =&gt; any . Note that the syntactic representation of map() is %{optional(any) =&gt; any} , not %{} . The notation %{} specifies the singleton type for the empty map. Keyword Lists Beyond keyword() and keyword(t) , it can be helpful to compose a spec for an expected keyword list. For example: @type option :: { :name , String . t } | { :max , pos_integer } | { :min , pos_integer } @type options :: [ option ( ) ] This makes it clear that only these options are allowed, none are required, and order does not matter. It also allows composition with existing types. For example: type option :: { :my_option , String . t ( ) } | GenServer . option ( ) @spec start_link ( [ option ( ) ] ) :: GenServer . on_start ( ) def start_link ( opts ) do { my_opts , gen_server_opts } = Keyword . split ( opts , [ :my_option ] ) GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , my_opts , gen_server_opts ) end User-defined types The @type , @typep , and @opaque module attributes can be used to define new types: @type type_name :: type @typep type_name :: type @opaque type_name :: type A type defined with @typep is private. An opaque type, defined with @opaque is a type where the internal structure of the type will not be visible, but the type is still public. Types can be parameterized by defining variables as parameters; these variables can then be used to define the type. @type dict ( key , value ) :: [ { key , value } ]","ref":"typespecs.html#types-and-their-syntax","source_doc":"The syntax Elixir provides for type specifications is similar to [the one in Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html).

A behaviour module defines a set of functions and macros (referred to as callbacks ) that callback modules implementing that behaviour must export. This &quot;interface&quot; identifies the specific part of the component. For example, the GenServer behaviour and functions abstract away all the message-passing (sending and receiving) and error reporting that a &quot;server&quot; process will likely want to implement from the specific parts such as the actions that this server process has to perform. To define a behaviour module, it's enough to define one or more callbacks in that module.

Usually, behaviour modules know if they should call those callbacks based on configuration, or they check if the callbacks are defined with function_exported?/3 or macro_exported?/3 . Optional callbacks can be defined through the @optional_callbacks module attribute, which has to be a keyword list with function or macro name as key and arity as value. For example: defmodule MyBehaviour do @callback vital_fun ( ) :: any @callback non_vital_fun ( ) :: any @macrocallback non_vital_macro ( arg :: any ) :: Macro . t @optional_callbacks non_vital_fun : 0 , non_vital_macro : 1 end One example of optional callback in Elixir's standard library is GenServer.format_status/2 . Implementing behaviours To specify that a module implements a given behaviour, the @behaviour attribute must be used: defmodule MyBehaviour do @callback my_fun ( arg :: any ) :: any end defmodule MyCallbackModule do @behaviour MyBehaviour def my_fun ( arg ) , do : arg end If a callback module that implements a given behaviour doesn't export all the functions and macros defined by that behaviour, the user will be notified through warnings during the compilation process (no errors will happen). Elixir's standard library contains a few frequently used behaviours such as GenServer , Supervisor , and Application . Inspecting behaviours The @callback and @optional_callbacks attributes are used to create a behaviour_info/1 function available on the defining module. This function can be used to retrieve the callbacks and optional callbacks defined by that module. For example, for the MyBehaviour module defined in &quot;Optional callbacks&quot; above: MyBehaviour . behaviour_info ( :callbacks ) #=&gt; [vital_fun: 0, &quot;MACRO-non_vital_macro&quot;: 2, non_vital_fun: 0] MyBehaviour . behaviour_info ( :optional_callbacks ) #=&gt; [&quot;MACRO-non_vital_macro&quot;: 2, non_vital_fun: 0] When using iex , the IEx.Helpers.b/1 helper is also available.","ref":"typespecs.html#behaviours","source_doc":"| float()\n          | integer()\n          | neg_integer()           # ..., -3, -2, -1\n          | non_neg_integer()       # 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n          | pos_integer()           # 1, 2, 3, ...","title":"Typespecs - Behaviours","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Elixir discourages the use of the string() type.

R1. Default Identifiers The general Elixir identifier rule is specified as: &lt; Identifier &gt; := &lt; Start &gt; &lt; Continue &gt; * &lt; Ending &gt; ? where &lt;Start&gt; uses the same categories as the spec but normalizes them to the NFC form (see R4): characters derived from the Unicode General Category of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, titlecase letters, modifier letters, other letters, letter numbers, plus Other_ID_Start , minus Pattern_Syntax and Pattern_White_Space code points In set notation: [\\p{L}\\p{Nl}\\p{Other_ID_Start}-\\p{Pattern_Syntax}-\\p{Pattern_White_Space}] . and &lt;Continue&gt; uses the same categories as the spec but normalizes them to the NFC form (see R4): ID_Start characters, plus characters having the Unicode General Category of nonspacing marks, spacing combining marks, decimal number, connector punctuation, plus Other_ID_Continue , minus Pattern_Syntax and Pattern_White_Space code points. In set notation: [\\p{ID_Start}\\p{Mn}\\p{Mc}\\p{Nd}\\p{Pc}\\p{Other_ID_Continue}-\\p{Pattern_Syntax}-\\p{Pattern_White_Space}] . &lt;Ending&gt; is an addition specific to Elixir that includes only the code points ? (003F) and ! (0021). The spec also provides a &lt;Medial&gt; set, but Elixir does not include any character on this set. Therefore, the identifier rule has been simplified to consider this. Elixir does not allow the use of ZWJ or ZWNJ in identifiers and therefore does not implement R1a. Bidirectional control characters are also not supported. R1b is guaranteed for backwards compatibility purposes. Atoms Unicode atoms in Elixir follow the identifier rule above with the following modifications: &lt;Start&gt; additionally includes the code point _ (005F) &lt;Continue&gt; additionally includes the code point @ (0040) Note atoms can also be quoted, which allows any characters, such as :&quot;hello elixir&quot; . All Elixir operators are also valid atoms, such as :+ , :@ , :|&gt; , and others. The full description of valid atoms is available in the &quot;Atoms&quot; section in the syntax reference . Variables, local calls, and remote calls Variables in Elixir follow the identifier rule above with the following modifications: &lt;Start&gt; additionally includes the code point _ (005F) &lt;Start&gt; additionally excludes Lu (letter uppercase) and Lt (letter titlecase) characters In set notation: [\\u{005F}\\p{Ll}\\p{Lm}\\p{Lo}\\p{Nl}\\p{Other_ID_Start}-\\p{Pattern_Syntax}-\\p{Pattern_White_Space}] . Aliases Aliases in Elixir only allow ASCII characters, starting in uppercase, and no punctuation characters. R3. Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax Characters Elixir supports only code points \\t (0009), \\n (000A), \\r (000D) and \\s (0020) as whitespace and therefore does not follow requirement R3. R3 requires a wider variety of whitespace and syntax characters to be supported. R4. Equivalent Normalized Identifiers Identifiers in Elixir are case sensitive. Elixir normalizes all atoms and variables to NFC form. Quoted-atoms and strings can, however, be in any form and are not verified by the parser. In other words, the atom :jos칠 can only be written with the code points 006A 006F 0073 00E9 or 006A 006F 0073 0065 0301 , but Elixir will rewrite it to the former (from Elixir 1.14). On the other hand, :&quot;jos칠&quot; may be written as 006A 006F 0073 00E9 or 006A 006F 0073 0065 0301 and its form will be retained, since it is written between quotes.

C1. General Security Profile for Identifiers Elixir will not allow tokenization of identifiers with codepoints in \\p{Identifier_Status=Restricted} . An implementation following the General Security Profile does not permit any characters in \\p{Identifier_Status=Restricted}, ... For instance, the 'HANGUL FILLER' (  ) character, which is often invisible, is an uncommon codepoint and will trigger this warning. See the note below about additional normalizations, which can perform automatic replacement of some Restricted identifiers. C2. Confusable detection Elixir will warn on identifiers that look the same, but aren't. Examples: in 햟 = a = 1 , the two 'a' characters are Cyrillic and Latin, and could be confused for each other; in 궅 =  = 1 , both are Japanese, but different codepoints, in different scripts of that writing system. Confusable identifiers can lead to hard-to-catch bugs (say, due to copy-pasted code) and can be unsafe, so we will warn about identifiers within a single file that could be confused with each other. We use the means described in Section 4, 'Confusable Detection', with one noted modification Alternatively, it shall declare that it uses a modification, and provide a precise list of character mappings that are added to or removed from the provided ones. Elixir will not warn on confusability for identifiers made up exclusively of characters in a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _. This is because ASCII identifiers have existed for so long that the programming community has had their own means of dealing with confusability between identifiers like l,1 or O,0 (for instance, fonts designed for programming usually make it easy to differentiate between those characters). C3. Mixed Script Detection Elixir will not allow tokenization of mixed-script identifiers unless the mixings is one of the exceptions defined in UTS 39 5.2, 'Highly Restrictive'. We use the means described in Section 5.1, Mixed-Script Detection, to determine if script mixing is occurring, with the modification documented in the section 'Additional Normalizations', below. Examples: Elixir allows an identifiers like 嵐뉚 , even though it includes characters from multiple 'scripts', because those scripts all 'resolve' to Japanese when applying the resolution rules from UTS 39 5.1. It also allows an atom like :T , the Japanese word for 't-shirt', which incorporates a Latin capital T, because {Latn, Jpan} is one of the allowed script mixings in the definition of 'Highly Restrictive' in UTS 39 5.2, and it 'covers' the string. However, Elixir would prevent tokenization in code like if 햟dmin, do: :ok, else: :err , where the scriptset for the 'a' character is {Cyrillic} but all other characters have scriptsets of {Latin}. The scriptsets fail to resolve, and the scriptsets from the definition of 'Highly Restrictive' in UTS 39 5.2 do not cover the string either, so a descriptive error is shown. C4, C5 (inapplicable) 'C4 - Restriction Level detection' conformance is not claimed and does not apply to identifiers in code; rather, it applies to classifying the level of safety of a given arbitrary string into one of 5 restriction levels. 'C5 - Mixed number detection' conformance is inapplicable as Elixir does not support Unicode numbers. Addition normalizations and documented UTS 39 modifications As of Elixir 1.14, some codepoints in \\p{Identifier_Status=Restricted} are normalized to other, unrestricted codepoints. Initially this is only done to translate MICRO SIGN 췃 to Greek lowercase mu, 풮 . This is not a modification of UTS39 clauses C1 (General Security Profile) or C2 (Confusability Detection); however, it is a documented modification of C3, 'Mixed-Script detection'. Mixed-script detection is modified by these normalizations to the extent that the normalized codepoint is given the union of scriptsets from both characters. For instance, in the example of MICRO =&gt; MU, Micro was a 'Common'-script character -- the same script given to the '_' underscore codepoint -- and thus the normalized character's scriptset will be {Greek, Common}. 'Common' intersects with all non-empty scriptsets, and thus the normalized character can be used in tokens written in any script without causing script mixing. The code points normalized in this fashion are those that are in use in the community, and judged not likely to cause issues with unsafe script mixing. For instance, the MICRO or MU codepoint may be used in an atom or variable dealing with microseconds.","ref":"unicode-syntax.html#unicode-technical-standard-39","source_doc":"The general Elixir identifier rule is specified as:\n\n    <Identifier> := <Start> <Continue>* <Ending>?\n\nwhere `<Start>` uses the same categories as the spec but normalizes them to the NFC form (see R4):\n\n> characters derived from the Unicode General Category of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, titlecase letters, modifier letters, other letters, letter numbers, plus `Other_ID_Start`, minus `Pattern_Syntax` and `Pattern_White_Space` code points\n>\n> In set notation: `[\\p{L}\\p{Nl}\\p{Other_ID_Start}-\\p{Pattern_Syntax}-\\p{Pattern_White_Space}]`.\n\nand `<Continue>` uses the same categories as the spec but normalizes them to the NFC form (see R4):\n\n> ID_Start characters, plus characters having the Unicode General Category of nonspacing marks, spacing combining marks, decimal number, connector punctuation, plus `Other_ID_Continue`, minus `Pattern_Syntax` and `Pattern_White_Space` code points.\n>\n> In set notation: `[\\p{ID_Start}\\p{Mn}\\p{Mc}\\p{Nd}\\p{Pc}\\p{Other_ID_Continue}-\\p{Pattern_Syntax}-\\p{Pattern_White_Space}]`.\n\n`<Ending>` is an addition specific to Elixir that includes only the code points `?` (003F) and `!` (0021).\n\nThe spec also provides a `<Medial>` set, but Elixir does not include any character on this set.

Documentation is an explicit contract between you and users of your Application Programming Interface (API), be them third-party developers, co-workers, or your future self. Modules and functions must always be documented if they are part of your API. Code comments are aimed at developers reading the code. They are useful for marking improvements, leaving notes (for example, why you had to resort to a workaround due to a bug in a library), and so forth. They are tied to the source code: you can completely rewrite a function and remove all existing code comments, and it will continue to behave the same, with no change to either its behaviour or its documentation. Because private functions cannot be accessed externally, Elixir will warn if a private function has a @doc attribute and will discard its content.

While these modules and functions can be accessed, they are meant to be internal to the library and thus should not have documentation for end users. Conveniently, Elixir allows developers to hide modules and functions from the documentation, by setting @doc false to hide a particular function, or @moduledoc false to hide the whole module. If a module is hidden, you may even document the functions in the module, but the module itself won't be listed in the documentation: defmodule MyApp.Hidden do @moduledoc false @doc &quot;&quot;&quot; This function won&#39;t be listed in docs. &quot;&quot;&quot; def function_that_wont_be_listed_in_docs do # ... end end In case you don't want to hide a whole module, you can hide functions individually: defmodule MyApp.Sample do @doc false def add ( a , b ) , do : a + b end However, keep in mind @moduledoc false or @doc false do not make a function private. The function above can still be invoked as MyApp.Sample.add(1, 2) . Not only that, if MyApp.Sample is imported, the add/2 function will also be imported into the caller. For those reasons, be cautious when adding @doc false to functions, instead use one of these two options: Move the undocumented function to a module with @moduledoc false , like MyApp.Hidden , ensuring the function won't be accidentally exposed or imported. Remember that you can use @moduledoc false to hide a whole module and still document each function with @doc . Tools will still ignore the module. Start the function name with one or two underscores, for example, __add__/2 . Functions starting with underscore are automatically treated as hidden, although you can also be explicit and add @doc false . The compiler does not import functions with leading underscores and they hint to anyone reading the code of their intended private usage.","ref":"writing-documentation.html#hiding-internal-modules-and-functions","source_doc":"Note that doctests have limitations.

Documentation is an explicit contract between you and users of your Application Programming Interface (API), be them third-party developers, co-workers, or your future self. Modules and functions must always be documented if they are part of your API.\n\nCode comments are aimed at developers reading the code. They are useful for marking improvements, leaving notes (for example, why you had to resort to a workaround due to a bug in a library), and so forth. They are tied to the source code: you can completely rewrite a function and remove all existing code comments, and it will continue to behave the same, with no change to either its behaviour or its documentation.\n\nBecause private functions cannot be accessed externally, Elixir will warn if a private function has a `@doc` attribute and will discard its content.

The larger the code path, the more work Erlang has to do in order to find a module. In previous versions, Mix would only add entries to the load paths.

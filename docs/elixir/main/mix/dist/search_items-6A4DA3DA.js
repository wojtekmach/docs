searchNodes=[{"doc":"Mix is a build tool that provides tasks for creating, compiling, and testing Elixir projects, managing its dependencies, and more. Mix.Project The foundation of Mix is a project. A project can be defined by using Mix.Project in a module, usually placed in a file named mix.exs : defmodule MyApp.MixProject do use Mix.Project def project do [ app : :my_app , version : &quot;1.0.0&quot; ] end end See the Mix.Project module for detailed documentation on Mix projects. Once the project is defined, a number of default Mix tasks can be run directly from the command line: mix compile - compiles the current project mix test - runs tests for the given project mix run - runs a particular command inside the project Each task has its own options and sometimes specific configuration to be defined in the project/0 function. You can use mix help to list all available tasks and mix help NAME to show help for a particular task. The best way to get started with your first project is by calling mix new my_project from the command line. Mix.Task Tasks are what make Mix extensible. Projects can extend Mix behaviour by adding their own tasks. For example, adding the task below inside your project will make it available to everyone that uses your project: defmodule Mix.Tasks.Hello do use Mix.Task def run ( _ ) do Mix . shell ( ) . info ( &quot;Hello world&quot; ) end end The task can now be invoked with mix hello . See the Mix.Task behaviour for detailed documentation on Mix tasks. Dependencies Mix also manages your dependencies and integrates nicely with the Hex package manager . In order to use dependencies, you need to add a :deps key to your project configuration. We often extract the list of dependencies into its own function: defmodule MyApp.MixProject do use Mix.Project def project do [ app : :my_app , version : &quot;1.0.0&quot; , deps : deps ( ) ] end defp deps do [ { :ecto , &quot;~&gt; 2.0&quot; } , { :plug , github : &quot;elixir-lang/plug&quot; } ] end end You can run mix help deps to learn more about dependencies in Mix. Environments Mix supports different environments. Environments allow developers to prepare and organize their project specifically for different scenarios. By default, Mix provides three environments: :dev - the default environment :test - the environment mix test runs on :prod - the environment your dependencies run on The environment can be changed via the command line by setting the MIX_ENV environment variable, for example: $ MIX_ENV=prod mix run server.exs You can also specify that certain dependencies are available only for certain environments: { :some_test_dependency , &quot;~&gt; 1.0&quot; , only : :test } When running Mix via the command line, you can configure the default environment or the preferred environment per task via the def cli function in your mix.exs . For example: def cli do [ default_env : :local , preferred_envs : [ docs : :docs ] ] end The environment can be read via Mix.env/0 . Targets Besides environments, Mix supports targets. Targets are useful when a project needs to compile to different architectures and some of the dependencies are only available to some of them. By default, the target is :host but it can be set via the MIX_TARGET environment variable. When running Mix via the command line, you can configure the default target or the preferred target per task via the def cli function in your mix.exs . For example: def cli do [ default_target : :local , preferred_targets : [ docs : :docs ] ] end The target can be read via Mix.target/0 . Configuration Mix allows you configure the application environment of your application and of your dependencies. See the Application module to learn more about the application environment. On this section, we will focus on how to configure it at two distinct moments: build-time and runtime. Avoiding the application environment The application environment is discouraged for libraries. See Elixir's Library Guidelines for more information. Build-time configuration Whenever you invoke a mix command, Mix loads the configuration in config/config.exs , if said file exists. It is common for the config/config.exs file itself to import other configuration based on the current MIX_ENV , such as config/dev.exs , config/test.exs , and config/prod.exs , by calling Config.import_config/1 : import Config import_config &quot; \#{ config_env ( ) } .exs&quot; We say config/config.exs and all imported files are build-time configuration as they are evaluated whenever you compile your code. In other words, if your configuration does something like: import Config config :my_app , :secret_key , System . fetch_env! ( &quot;MY_APP_SECRET_KEY&quot; ) The :secret_key key under :my_app will be computed on the host machine before your code compiles. This can be an issue if the machine compiling your code does not have access to all environment variables used to run your code, as loading the config above will fail due to the missing environment variable. Furthermore, even if the environment variable is set, changing the environment variable will require a full recompilation of your application by calling mix compile --force (otherwise your project won't start). Luckily, Mix also provides runtime configuration, which is preferred in such cases and we will see next. Runtime configuration To enable runtime configuration in your release, all you need to do is to create a file named config/runtime.exs : import Config config :my_app , :secret_key , System . fetch_env! ( &quot;MY_APP_SECRET_KEY&quot; ) This file is executed whenever your project runs. If you assemble a release with mix release , it also executes every time your release starts. Aliases Aliases are shortcuts or tasks specific to the current project. In the Mix.Task section , we have defined a task that would be available to everyone using our project as a dependency. What if we wanted the task to only be available for our project? Just define an alias: defmodule MyApp.MixProject do use Mix.Project def project do [ app : :my_app , version : &quot;1.0.0&quot; , aliases : aliases ( ) ] end defp aliases do [ c : &quot;compile&quot; , hello : &amp; hello / 1 , paid_task : &amp; paid_task / 1 ] end defp hello ( _ ) do Mix . shell ( ) . info ( &quot;Hello world&quot; ) end defp paid_task ( _ ) do Mix.Task . run ( &quot;paid.task&quot; , [ &quot;first_arg&quot; , &quot;second_arg&quot; , &quot;--license-key&quot; , System . fetch_env! ( &quot;SOME_LICENSE_KEY&quot; ) ] ) end end In the example above, we have defined three aliases. One is mix c which is a shortcut for mix compile . Another is named mix hello , which is the equivalent to the Mix.Tasks.Hello we have defined in the Mix.Task section . The third is named mix paid_task , which runs the task paid.task with several arguments, including one pulled from an environment variable. Defining this as a function means that the environment variable is only evaluated when this specific task is run, not when mix.exs is loaded before each mix command. Aliases may also be lists, specifying multiple tasks to be run consecutively: [ all : [ &amp; hello / 1 , &quot;deps.get --only \#{ Mix . env ( ) } &quot; , &quot;compile&quot; ] ] In the example above, we have defined an alias named mix all , that prints &quot;Hello world&quot;, then fetches dependencies specific to the current environment, and compiles the project. Aliases can also be used to augment existing tasks. Let's suppose you want to augment mix clean to clean another directory Mix does not know about: [ clean : [ &quot;clean&quot; , &amp; clean_extra / 1 ] ] Where &amp;clean_extra/1 would be a function in your mix.exs with extra cleanup logic. Arguments given to the alias will be appended to the arguments of the last task in the list. Except when overriding an existing task. In this case, the arguments will be given to the original task, in order to preserve semantics. For example, in the :clean alias above, the arguments given to the alias will be passed to &quot;clean&quot; and not to clean_extra/1 . Aliases defined in the current project do not affect its dependencies and aliases defined in dependencies are not accessible from the current project. Aliases can be used very powerfully to also run Elixir scripts and shell commands, for example: # priv/hello1.exs IO . puts ( &quot;Hello One&quot; ) # priv/hello2.exs IO . puts ( &quot;Hello Two&quot; ) # priv/world.sh #!/bin/sh echo &quot;world!&quot; # mix.exs defp aliases do [ some_alias : [ &quot;hex.info&quot; , &quot;run priv/hello1.exs&quot; , &quot;cmd priv/world.sh&quot; ] ] end In the example above we have created the alias some_alias that will run the task mix hex.info , then mix run to run an Elixir script, then mix cmd to execute a command line shell script. This shows how powerful aliases mixed with Mix tasks can be. Mix tasks are designed to run only once. This prevents the same task from being executed multiple times. For example, if there are several tasks depending on mix compile , the code will be compiled once. Tasks can be executed again if they are explicitly reenabled using Mix.Task.reenable/1 : another_alias : [ &quot;format --check-formatted priv/hello1.exs&quot; , &quot;cmd priv/world.sh&quot; , fn _ -&gt; Mix.Task . reenable ( &quot;format&quot; ) end , &quot;format --check-formatted priv/hello2.exs&quot; ] Some tasks are automatically reenabled though, as they are expected to be invoked multiple times. They are: mix cmd , mix do , mix loadconfig , mix profile.cprof , mix profile.eprof , mix profile.fprof , mix run , and mix xref . It is worth mentioning that some tasks, such as in the case of the mix format command in the example above, can accept multiple files so it could be rewritten as: another_alias : [ &quot;format --check-formatted priv/hello1.exs priv/hello2.exs&quot; ] Environment variables Several environment variables can be used to modify Mix's behaviour. Mix responds to the following variables: MIX_ARCHIVES - specifies the directory into which the archives should be installed (default: ~/.mix/archives ) MIX_BUILD_PATH - sets the project Mix.Project.build_path/0 config. This option must always point to a subdirectory inside a temporary directory. For instance, never &quot;/tmp&quot; or &quot;_build&quot; but &quot;_build/PROD&quot; or &quot;/tmp/PROD&quot;, as required by Mix. This environment variable is used mostly by external build tools. For your CI servers, you likely want to use MIX_BUILD_ROOT below. MIX_BUILD_ROOT - sets the root directory where build artifacts should be written to. For example, &quot;_build&quot;. If MIX_BUILD_PATH is set, this option is ignored. MIX_DEBUG - outputs debug information about each task before running it MIX_DEPS_PATH - sets the project Mix.Project.deps_path/0 config for the current project (default: deps ) MIX_ENV - specifies which environment should be used. See Environments MIX_EXS - changes the full path to the mix.exs file MIX_HOME - path to Mix's home directory, stores configuration files and scripts used by Mix (default: ~/.mix ) MIX_INSTALL_DIR - (since v1.12.0) specifies directory where Mix.install/2 keeps install cache MIX_INSTALL_FORCE - (since v1.13.0) runs Mix.install/2 with empty install cache MIX_PATH - appends extra code paths MIX_QUIET - does not print information messages to the terminal MIX_REBAR3 - path to rebar3 command that overrides the one Mix installs (default: ~/.mix/rebar3 ) MIX_TARGET - specifies which target should be used. See Targets MIX_XDG - asks Mix to follow the XDG Directory Specification for its home directory and configuration files. This behaviour needs to be opt-in due to backwards compatibility. MIX_HOME has higher preference than MIX_XDG . If none of the variables are set, the default directory ~/.mix will be used Environment variables that are not meant to hold a value (and act basically as flags) should be set to either 1 or true , for example: $ MIX_DEBUG=1 mix compile","ref":"Mix.html","source_doc":"Mix is a build tool that provides tasks for creating, compiling,\nand testing Elixir projects, managing its dependencies, and more.\n\n## Mix.Project\n\nThe foundation of Mix is a project. A project can be defined by using\n`Mix.Project` in a module, usually placed in a file named `mix.exs`:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.MixProject do\n      use Mix.Project\n\n      def project do\n        [\n          app: :my_app,\n          version: \"1.0.0\"\n        ]\n      end\n    end\n\nSee the `Mix.Project` module for detailed documentation on Mix projects.\n\nOnce the project is defined, a number of default Mix tasks can be run\ndirectly from the command line:\n\n  * `mix compile` - compiles the current project\n  * `mix test` - runs tests for the given project\n  * `mix run` - runs a particular command inside the project\n\nEach task has its own options and sometimes specific configuration\nto be defined in the `project/0` function. You can use `mix help`\nto list all available tasks and `mix help NAME` to show help for\na particular task.\n\nThe best way to get started with your first project is by calling\n`mix new my_project` from the command line.\n\n## Mix.Task\n\nTasks are what make Mix extensible.\n\nProjects can extend Mix behaviour by adding their own tasks. For\nexample, adding the task below inside your project will\nmake it available to everyone that uses your project:\n\n    defmodule Mix.Tasks.Hello do\n      use Mix.Task\n\n      def run(_) do\n        Mix.shell().info(\"Hello world\")\n      end\n    end\n\nThe task can now be invoked with `mix hello`.\n\nSee the `Mix.Task` behaviour for detailed documentation on Mix tasks.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nMix also manages your dependencies and integrates nicely with the [Hex package\nmanager](https://hex.pm).\n\nIn order to use dependencies, you need to add a `:deps` key\nto your project configuration.

Environments allow developers\nto prepare and organize their project specifically for different\nscenarios. By default, Mix provides three environments:\n\n  * `:dev` - the default environment\n  * `:test` - the environment `mix test` runs on\n  * `:prod` - the environment your dependencies run on\n\nThe environment can be changed via the command line by setting\nthe `MIX_ENV` environment variable, for example:\n\n```bash\n$ MIX_ENV=prod mix run server.exs\n```\n\nYou can also specify that certain dependencies are available only for\ncertain environments:\n\n    {:some_test_dependency, \"~> 1.0\", only: :test}\n\nWhen running Mix via the command line, you can configure the default\nenvironment or the preferred environment per task via the `def cli`\nfunction in your `mix.exs`. For example:\n\n    def cli do\n      [\n        default_env: :local,\n        preferred_envs: [docs: :docs]\n      ]\n    end\n\nThe environment can be read via `Mix.env/0`.\n\n## Targets\n\nBesides environments, Mix supports targets. Targets are useful when a\nproject needs to compile to different architectures and some of the\ndependencies are only available to some of them. By default, the target\nis `:host` but it can be set via the `MIX_TARGET` environment variable.\n\nWhen running Mix via the command line, you can configure the default\ntarget or the preferred target per task via the `def cli` function\nin your `mix.exs`. For example:\n\n    def cli do\n      [\n        default_target: :local,\n        preferred_targets: [docs: :docs]\n      ]\n    end\n\nThe target can be read via `Mix.target/0`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nMix allows you configure the application environment of your application\nand of your dependencies.

One is `mix c`\nwhich is a shortcut for `mix compile`. Another is named\n`mix hello`, which is the equivalent to the `Mix.Tasks.Hello`\nwe have defined in the [Mix.Task section](#module-mix-task).\n\nThe third is named `mix paid_task`, which runs the task `paid.task` with\nseveral arguments, including one pulled from an environment variable.\nDefining this as a function means that the environment variable is only\nevaluated when this specific task is run, not when `mix.exs` is loaded\nbefore each `mix` command.\n\nAliases may also be lists, specifying multiple tasks to be run\nconsecutively:\n\n    [all: [&hello/1, \"deps.get --only \#{Mix.env()}\", \"compile\"]]\n\nIn the example above, we have defined an alias named `mix all`,\nthat prints \"Hello world\", then fetches dependencies specific\nto the current environment, and compiles the project.\n\nAliases can also be used to augment existing tasks. Let's suppose\nyou want to augment `mix clean` to clean another directory Mix does\nnot know about:\n\n    [clean: [\"clean\", &clean_extra/1]]\n\nWhere `&clean_extra/1` would be a function in your `mix.exs`\nwith extra cleanup logic.\n\nArguments given to the alias will be appended to the arguments of\nthe last task in the list.

After each successful installation, a given set of dependencies is cached so starting another VM and calling Mix.install/2 with the same dependencies will avoid unnecessary downloads and compilations. The location of the cache directory can be controlled using the MIX_INSTALL_DIR environment variable. This function can only be called outside of a Mix project and only with the same dependencies in the given VM. Note: this feature is currently experimental and it may change in future releases. Options :force - if true , runs with empty install cache. This is useful when you want to update your dependencies or your install got into an inconsistent state. To use this option, you can also set the MIX_INSTALL_FORCE environment variable. (Default: false ) :verbose - if true , prints additional debugging information (Default: false ) :consolidate_protocols - if true , runs protocol consolidation via the mix compile.protocols task (Default: true ) :elixir - if set, ensures the current Elixir version matches the given version requirement (Default: nil ) :system_env (since v1.13.0) - a list or a map of system environment variable names with respective values as binaries. The system environment is made part of the Mix.install/2 cache, so different configurations will lead to different apps :config (since v1.13.0) - a keyword list of keyword lists of compile-time configuration. The configuration is part of the Mix.install/2 cache, so different configurations will lead to different apps. For this reason, you want to minimize the amount of configuration set through this option. Use Application.put_all_env/4 for setting other runtime configuration. :config_path (since v1.14.0) - path to a configuration file. If a runtime.exs file exists in the same directory as the given path, it is loaded too. :lockfile (since v1.14.0) - path to a lockfile to be used as a basis of dependency resolution. Examples Installing :decimal and :jason : Mix . install ( [ :decimal , { :jason , &quot;~&gt; 1.0&quot; } ] ) Installing :nx and :exla , and configuring the underlying applications and environment variables: Mix . install ( [ :nx , :exla ] , config : [ nx : [ default_backend : EXLA ] ] , system_env : [ XLA_TARGET : &quot;cuda111&quot; ] ) Installing a Mix project as a path dependency along with its configuration and deps: # $ git clone https://github.com/hexpm/hexpm /tmp/hexpm # $ cd /tmp/hexpm &amp;&amp; mix setup Mix . install ( [ { :hexpm , path : &quot;/tmp/hexpm&quot; , env : :dev } , ] , config_path : &quot;/tmp/hexpm/config/config.exs&quot; , lockfile : &quot;/tmp/hexpm/mix.lock&quot; ) Hexpm.Repo . query! ( &quot;SELECT COUNT(1) from packages&quot; ) #=&gt; ... The example above can be simplified by passing the application name as an atom for :config_path and :lockfile : Mix . install ( [ { :hexpm , path : &quot;/tmp/hexpm&quot; , env : :dev } , ] , config_path : :hexpm , lockfile : :hexpm ) Limitations There is one limitation to Mix.install/2 , which is actually an Elixir behaviour. If you are installing a dependency that defines a struct or macro, you cannot use the struct or macro immediately after the install call. For example, this won't work: Mix . install ( [ :decimal ] ) % Decimal { } = Decimal . new ( 42 ) That's because Elixir first expands all structs and all macros, and then it executes the code. This means that, by the time Elixir tries to expand the %Decimal{} struct, the dependency has not been installed yet. Luckily this has a straightforward solution, which is move the code to inside a module: Mix . install ( [ :decimal ] ) defmodule Script do def run do % Decimal { } = Decimal . new ( 42 ) end end Script . run ( ) The contents inside defmodule will only be expanded and executed after Mix.install/2 runs, which means that any struct, macros, and imports will be correctly handled.","ref":"Mix.html#install/2","source_doc":"Installs and starts dependencies.\n\nThe given `deps` should be in the same format as defined in a regular Mix\nproject.

This configuration can be read using Mix.Project.config/0 . Note that config/0 won't fail if a project is not defined; this allows many Mix tasks to work without a project. If a task requires a project to be defined or needs to access a special function within the project, the task can call Mix.Project.get!/0 which fails with Mix.NoProjectError in the case a project is not defined. There isn't a comprehensive list of all the options that can be returned by project/0 since many Mix tasks define their own options that they read from this configuration. For example, look at the &quot;Configuration&quot; section in the documentation for the Mix.Tasks.Compile task. These are a few options that are not used by just one Mix task (and will thus be documented here): :build_per_environment - if true , builds will be per-environment .

See config_files/0 for more information. Defaults to &quot;config/config.exs&quot; . :deps - a list of dependencies of this project.

Note that different tasks may share the same configuration option. For example, the :erlc_paths configuration is used by mix compile.erlang , mix compile.yecc , and other tasks. CLI configuration Mix is most often invoked from the command line. For this purpose, you may define a specific cli/0 function which customizes default values when executed from the CLI. For example: def cli do [ default_task : &quot;phx.server&quot; , default_envs : [ docs : :docs ] ] end The example above sets the default task (used by iex -S mix and mix ) to phx.server . It also sets the default environment for the &quot;mix docs&quot; task to be &quot;docs&quot;.

Invoking this module This module contains many functions that return project information and metadata. However, since Mix is not included nor configured during releases, we recommend using the functions in this module only inside Mix tasks. If you need to configure your own app, consider using the application environment instead. For example, don't do this: def some_config do Mix.Project . config ( ) [ :some_config ] end Nor this: @some_config Mix.Project . config ( ) [ :some_config ] Instead, do this: def some_config do Application . get_env ( :my_app , :some_config ) end Or this: @some_config Application . compile_env ( :my_app , :some_config )","ref":"Mix.Project.html","source_doc":"Defines and manipulates Mix projects.\n\nA Mix project is defined by calling `use Mix.Project` in a module, usually\nplaced in `mix.exs`:\n\n    defmodule MyApp.MixProject do\n      use Mix.Project\n\n      def project do\n        [\n          app: :my_app,\n          version: \"1.0.0\"\n        ]\n      end\n    end\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn order to configure Mix, the module that `use`s `Mix.Project` should export\na `project/0` function that returns a keyword list representing configuration\nfor the project.\n\nThis configuration can be read using `Mix.Project.config/0`.

This setting also\nmakes sure Elixir is not added as a dependency to the generated `.app` file or\nto the escript generated with `mix escript.build`, and so on.\n\n## Invoking this module\n\nThis module contains many functions that return project information and\nmetadata. However, since Mix is not included nor configured during releases,\nwe recommend using the functions in this module only inside Mix tasks.\nIf you need to configure your own app, consider using the application\nenvironment instead. For example, don't do this:\n\n    def some_config do\n      Mix.Project.config()[:some_config]\n    end\n\nNor this:\n\n    @some_config Mix.Project.config()[:some_config]\n\nInstead, do this:\n\n    def some_config do\n      Application.get_env(:my_app, :some_config)\n    end\n\nOr this:\n\n    @some_config Application.compile_env(:my_app, :some_config)\n\n","title":"Mix.Project","type":"module"},{"doc":"Returns the application path inside the build.

A Mix task can be defined by using Mix.Task in a module whose name begins with Mix.Tasks. and which defines the run/1 function. Typically, task modules live inside the lib/mix/tasks/ directory, and their file names use dot separators instead of underscores (e.g. deps.clean.ex ) - although ultimately the file name is not relevant. For example: # lib/mix/tasks/echo.ex defmodule Mix.Tasks.Echo do @moduledoc &quot;Printed when the user requests `mix help echo`&quot; @shortdoc &quot;Echoes arguments&quot; use Mix.Task @impl Mix.Task def run ( args ) do Mix . shell ( ) . info ( Enum . join ( args , &quot; &quot; ) ) end end The command name will correspond to the portion of the module name following Mix.Tasks. . For example, a module name of Mix.Tasks.Deps.Clean corresponds to a task name of deps.clean . The run/1 function will receive a list of all command line arguments passed, according to the user's terminal. For example, if the args in the above echo task were inspected, you might see something like this: $ mix echo &#39;A and B&#39; C --test [&quot;A and B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;--test&quot;] Define the @shortdoc attribute if you wish to make the task publicly visible on mix help . Omit this attribute if you do not want your task to be listed via mix help . The @moduledoc attribute may override @shortdoc . The task will not appear in mix help if documentation for the entire module is hidden with @moduledoc false . If a task has requirements, they can be listed using the @requirements attribute. For example: @requirements [ &quot;app.config&quot; ] Tasks typically depend on the &quot;app.config&quot; task, when they need to access code from the current project with all apps already configured, or the &quot;app.start&quot; task, when they also need those apps to be already started: @requirements [ &quot;app.start&quot; ] You can also run tasks directly with run/2 . Attributes There are a few attributes available in Mix tasks to configure them in Mix: @shortdoc - makes the task public with a short description that appears on mix help @recursive - runs the task recursively in umbrella projects @requirements - list of required tasks to be run before the task Documentation Users can read the documentation for public Mix tasks by running mix help my_task . The documentation that will be shown is the @moduledoc of the task's module.","ref":"Mix.Task.html","source_doc":"Provides conveniences for creating, loading, and manipulating Mix tasks.\n\nA Mix task can be defined by using `Mix.Task` in a module whose name\nbegins with `Mix.Tasks.` and which defines the `run/1` function.\nTypically, task modules live inside the `lib/mix/tasks/` directory,\nand their file names use dot separators instead of underscores\n(e.g. `deps.clean.ex`) - although ultimately the file name is not\nrelevant.\n\nFor example:\n\n    # lib/mix/tasks/echo.ex\n    defmodule Mix.Tasks.Echo do\n      @moduledoc \"Printed when the user requests `mix help echo`\"\n      @shortdoc \"Echoes arguments\"\n\n      use Mix.Task\n\n      @impl Mix.Task\n      def run(args) do\n        Mix.shell().info(Enum.join(args, \" \"))\n      end\n    end\n\nThe command name will correspond to the portion of the module\nname following `Mix.Tasks.`. For example, a module name of\n`Mix.Tasks.Deps.Clean` corresponds to a task name of `deps.clean`.\n\nThe `run/1` function will receive a list of all command line\narguments passed, according to the user's terminal.\n\nFor example, if the `args` in the above `echo` task were\ninspected, you might see something like this:\n\n    $ mix echo 'A and B' C --test\n    [\"A and B\", \"C\", \"--test\"]\n\nDefine the `@shortdoc` attribute if you wish to make the task\npublicly visible on `mix help`. Omit this attribute if you do\nnot want your task to be listed via `mix help`.\nThe `@moduledoc` attribute may override `@shortdoc`. The task\nwill not appear in `mix help` if documentation for the entire\nmodule is hidden with `@moduledoc false`.\n\nIf a task has requirements, they can be listed using the\n`@requirements` attribute. For example:\n\n    @requirements [\"app.config\"]\n\nTasks typically depend on the `\"app.config\"` task, when they\nneed to access code from the current project with all apps\nalready configured, or the \"app.start\" task, when they also\nneed those apps to be already started:\n\n    @requirements [\"app.start\"]\n\nYou can also run tasks directly with `run/2`.\n\n## Attributes\n\nThere are a few attributes available in Mix tasks to\nconfigure them in Mix:\n\n  * `@shortdoc`  - makes the task public with a short description that appears\n    on `mix help`\n  * `@recursive` - runs the task recursively in umbrella projects\n  * `@requirements` - list of required tasks to be run before the task\n\n## Documentation\n\nUsers can read the documentation for public Mix tasks by running `mix help my_task`.\nThe documentation that will be shown is the `@moduledoc` of the task's module.\n","title":"Mix.Task","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"Checks if the given task name is an alias.

An .app file is a file containing Erlang terms that defines your application. Mix automatically generates this file based on your mix.exs configuration. In order to generate the .app file, Mix expects your project to have both :app and :version keys. Furthermore, you can configure the generated application by defining an application/0 function in your mix.exs that returns a keyword list. The most commonly used keys are: :extra_applications - a list of OTP applications your application depends on which are not included in :deps (usually defined in deps/0 in your mix.exs ). For example, here you can declare a dependency on applications that ship with Erlang/OTP or Elixir, like :crypto or :logger . Optional extra applications can be declared as a tuple, such as {:ex_unit, :optional} . Mix guarantees all non-optional applications are started before your application starts. :registered - the name of all registered processes in the application. If your application defines a local GenServer with name MyServer , it is recommended to add MyServer to this list. It is most useful in detecting conflicts between applications that register the same names. :env - the default values for the application environment. The application environment is one of the most common ways to configure applications. See the Application module for mechanisms to read and write to the application environment. For example: def application do [ extra_applications : [ :logger , :crypto , ex_unit : :optional ] , env : [ key : :value ] , registered : [ MyServer ] ] end Other options include: :applications - all applications your application depends on at runtime. By default, this list is automatically inferred from your dependencies. Mix and other tools use the application list in order to start your dependencies before starting the application itself. :mod - specifies a module to invoke when the application is started. It must be in the format {Mod, args} where args is often an empty list. The module specified must implement the callbacks defined by the Application module. :start_phases - specifies a list of phases and their arguments to be called after the application is started. See the &quot;Phases&quot; section below. :included_applications - specifies a list of applications that will be included in the application. It is the responsibility of the primary application to start the supervision tree of all included applications, as only the primary application will be started. A process in an included application considers itself belonging to the primary application. :maxT - specifies the maximum time the application is allowed to run, in milliseconds. Applications are stopped if :maxT is reached, and their top-level supervisor terminated with reason :normal .

Note Hex expects the dependency requirement to always be given and it will warn otherwise.

Optional dependencies will not be started by the application. :only - the dependency is made available only in the given environments, useful when declaring dev- or test-only dependencies; by default the dependency will be available in all environments. The value of this option can either be a single environment (like :dev ) or a list of environments (like [:dev, :test] ) :targets - the dependency is made available only for the given targets. By default the dependency will be available in all environments. The value of this option can either be a single target (like :host ) or a list of environments (like [:host, :rpi3] ) :override - if set to true the dependency will override any other definitions of itself by other dependencies :manager - Mix can also compile Rebar3 and makefile projects and can fetch sub dependencies of Rebar3 projects. Mix will try to infer the type of project but it can be overridden with this option by setting it to :mix , :rebar3 , or :make . In case there are conflicting definitions, the first manager in the list above will be picked up. For example, if a dependency is found with :rebar3 as a manager in different part of the trees, :rebar3 will be automatically picked. You can find the manager by running mix deps and override it by setting the :override option in a top-level project. :runtime - whether the dependency is part of runtime applications.

If a .formatter.exs lists &quot;lib/app&quot; as a subdirectory, the rules in .formatter.exs won't be available in lib/app/.formatter.exs .

Pass this if you don't want this Mix task to fail (and return a non-zero exit code), but still want to check for format errors and print them to the console. --dry-run - does not save files after formatting. --dot-formatter - path to the file with formatter configuration. Defaults to .formatter.exs if one is available. See the &quot;Formatting options&quot; section above for more information. --stdin-filename - path to the file being formatted on stdin. This is useful if you are using plugins to support custom filetypes such as .heex . Without passing this flag, it is assumed that the code being passed via stdin is valid Elixir code. Defaults to &quot;stdin.exs&quot;. When to format code We recommend developers to format code directly in their editors, either automatically when saving a file or via an explicit command or key binding. If such option is not available in your editor of choice, adding the required integration is usually a matter of invoking: $ cd $project &amp;&amp; mix format $file where $file refers to the current file and $project is the root of your project. It is also possible to format code across the whole project by passing a list of patterns and files to mix format , as shown at the top of this task documentation. This list can also be set in the .formatter.exs file under the :inputs key. Plugins It is possible to customize how the formatter behaves. Plugins must implement the Mix.Tasks.Format behaviour. For example, imagine that your project uses Markdown in two distinct ways: via a custom ~M sigil and via files with the .md and .markdown extensions. A custom plugin would look like this: defmodule MixMarkdownFormatter do @behaviour Mix.Tasks.Format def features ( _opts ) do [ sigils : [ :M ] , extensions : [ &quot;.md&quot; , &quot;.markdown&quot; ] ] end def format ( contents , opts ) do # logic that formats markdown end end The opts passed to format/2 contains all the formatting options and either: :sigil (atom) - the sigil being formatted, e.g. :M . :modifiers (charlist) - list of sigil modifiers. :extension (string) - the extension of the file being formatted, e.g. &quot;.md&quot; . Now any application can use your formatter as follows: # .formatter.exs [ # Define the desired plugins plugins : [ MixMarkdownFormatter , AnotherMarkdownFormatter ] , # Remember to update the inputs list to include the new extensions inputs : [ &quot;{mix,.formatter}.exs&quot; , &quot;{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}&quot; , &quot;posts/*.{md,markdown}&quot; ] ] Remember that, when running the formatter with plugins, you must make sure that your dependencies and your application have been compiled, so the relevant plugin code can be loaded. Otherwise a warning is logged. In addition, the order by which you input your plugins is the format order. So, in the above .formatter.exs , the MixMarkdownFormatter will format the markdown files and sigils before AnotherMarkdownFormatter . Importing dependencies configuration This task supports importing formatter configuration from dependencies. A dependency that wants to export formatter configuration needs to have a .formatter.exs file at the root of the project. In this file, the dependency can list an :export option with configuration to export. For now, only one option is supported under :export : :locals_without_parens (whose value has the same shape as the value of the :locals_without_parens in Code.format_string!/2 ). The functions listed under :locals_without_parens in the :export option of a dependency can be imported in a project by listing that dependency in the :import_deps option of the formatter configuration file of the project. For example, consider you have a project called my_app that depends on another one called my_dep . my_dep wants to export some configuration, so my_dep/.formatter.exs would look like this: # my_dep/.formatter.exs [ # Regular formatter configuration for my_dep # ... export : [ locals_without_parens : [ some_dsl_call : 2 , some_dsl_call : 3 ] ] ] In order to import configuration, my_app 's .formatter.exs would look like this: # my_app/.formatter.exs [ import_deps : [ :my_dep ] ]","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Format.html","source_doc":"Formats the given files and patterns.\n\n    $ mix format mix.exs \"lib/**/*.{ex,exs}\" \"test/**/*.{ex,exs}\"\n\nIf any of the files is `-`, then the input is read from stdin and the output\nis written to stdout.\n\n## Formatting options\n\nThe formatter will read a `.formatter.exs` file in the current directory for\nformatter configuration.

Plugins must implement\nthe `Mix.Tasks.Format` behaviour. For example, imagine that your project uses\nMarkdown in two distinct ways: via a custom `~M` sigil and via files with the\n`.md` and `.markdown` extensions. A custom plugin would look like this:\n\n    defmodule MixMarkdownFormatter do\n      @behaviour Mix.Tasks.Format\n\n      def features(_opts) do\n        [sigils: [:M], extensions: [\".md\", \".markdown\"]]\n      end\n\n      def format(contents, opts) do\n        # logic that formats markdown\n      end\n    end\n\nThe `opts` passed to `format/2` contains all the formatting options and either:\n\n  * `:sigil` (atom) - the sigil being formatted, e.g. `:M`.\n\n  * `:modifiers` (charlist) - list of sigil modifiers.\n\n  * `:extension` (string) - the extension of the file being formatted, e.g. `\".md\"`.\n\nNow any application can use your formatter as follows:\n\n    # .formatter.exs\n    [\n      # Define the desired plugins\n      plugins: [MixMarkdownFormatter, AnotherMarkdownFormatter],\n      # Remember to update the inputs list to include the new extensions\n      inputs: [\"{mix,.formatter}.exs\", \"{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}\", \"posts/*.{md,markdown}\"]\n    ]\n\nRemember that, when running the formatter with plugins, you must make\nsure that your dependencies and your application have been compiled,\nso the relevant plugin code can be loaded. Otherwise a warning is logged.\n\nIn addition, the order by which you input your plugins is the format order.\nSo, in the above `.formatter.exs`, the `MixMarkdownFormatter` will format\nthe markdown files and sigils before `AnotherMarkdownFormatter`.\n\n## Importing dependencies configuration\n\nThis task supports importing formatter configuration from dependencies.\n\nA dependency that wants to export formatter configuration needs to have a\n`.formatter.exs` file at the root of the project. In this file, the dependency\ncan list an `:export` option with configuration to export. For now, only one\noption is supported under `:export`: `:locals_without_parens` (whose value has\nthe same shape as the value of the `:locals_without_parens` in `Code.format_string!/2`).\n\nThe functions listed under `:locals_without_parens` in the `:export` option of\na dependency can be imported in a project by listing that dependency in the\n`:import_deps` option of the formatter configuration file of the project.\n\nFor example, consider you have a project called `my_app` that depends on another one called `my_dep`.\n`my_dep` wants to export some configuration, so `my_dep/.formatter.exs`\nwould look like this:\n\n    # my_dep/.formatter.exs\n    [\n      # Regular formatter configuration for my_dep\n      # ...\n\n      export: [\n        locals_without_parens: [some_dsl_call: 2, some_dsl_call: 3]\n      ]\n    ]\n\nIn order to import configuration, `my_app`'s `.formatter.exs` would look like\nthis:\n\n    # my_app/.formatter.exs\n    [\n      import_deps: [:my_dep]\n    ]\n\n","title":"Mix.Tasks.Format","type":"task"},{"doc":"Returns a formatter function and the formatter options to be used for the given file.

A release can be configured in your mix.exs file under the :releases key inside def project : def project do [ releases : [ demo : [ include_executables_for : [ :unix ] , applications : [ runtime_tools : :permanent ] ] , ... ] ] end You can specify multiple releases where the key is the release name and the value is a keyword list with the release configuration. Releasing a certain name is done with: $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release demo If the given name does not exist, an error is raised. If mix release , without a name, is invoked and there are multiple names, an error will be raised unless you set default_release: NAME at the root of your project configuration. If mix release is invoked and there are no names, a release using the application name and default values is assembled. Why releases? Releases allow developers to precompile and package all of their code and the runtime into a single unit. The benefits of releases are: Code preloading. The VM has two mechanisms for loading code: interactive and embedded. By default, it runs in the interactive mode which dynamically loads modules when they are used for the first time. The first time your application calls Enum.map/2 , the VM will find the Enum module and load it. There's a downside: when you start a new server in production, it may need to load many other modules, causing the first requests to have an unusual spike in response time. With releases, the system preloads all modules and guarantees your system is ready to handle requests after booting. Configuration and customization. Releases give developers fine grained control over system configuration and the VM flags used to start the system. Self-contained. A release does not require the source code to be included in your production artifacts. All of the code is precompiled and packaged. Releases do not even require Erlang or Elixir in your servers, as it includes the Erlang VM and its runtime by default. Furthermore, both Erlang and Elixir standard libraries are stripped to bring only the parts you are actually using. Multiple releases. You can assemble different releases with different configuration per application or even with different applications altogether. Management scripts. Releases come with scripts to start, restart, connect to the running system remotely, execute RPC calls, run as daemon, run as a Windows service, and more. Running the release Once a release is assembled, you can start it by calling bin/RELEASE_NAME start inside the release. In production, you would do: $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release $ _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start bin/my_app start will start the system connected to the current standard input/output, where logs are also written to by default. This is the preferred way to run the system. Many tools, such as systemd , platforms as a service, such as Heroku, and many containers platforms, such as Docker, are capable of processing the standard input/output and redirecting the log contents elsewhere. Those tools and platforms also take care of restarting the system in case it crashes. You can also execute one-off commands, run the release as a daemon on Unix-like system, or install it as a service on Windows. We will take a look at those next. You can also list all available commands by invoking bin/RELEASE_NAME . One-off commands (eval and rpc) If you want to invoke specific modules and functions in your release, you can do so in two ways: using eval or rpc . $ bin/RELEASE_NAME eval &quot;IO.puts(:hello)&quot; $ bin/RELEASE_NAME rpc &quot;IO.puts(:hello)&quot; The eval command starts its own instance of the VM but without starting any of the applications in the release and without starting distribution. For example, if you need to do some prep work before running the actual system, like migrating your database, eval can be a good fit. Just keep in mind any application you may use during eval has to be explicitly loaded and/or started. You can start an application by calling Application.ensure_all_started/1 . However, if for some reason you cannot start an application, maybe because it will run other services you do not want, you must at least load the application by calling Application.load/1 . If you don't load the application, any attempt at reading its environment or configuration may fail. Note that if you start an application, it is automatically loaded before started. Another way to run commands is with rpc , which will connect to the system currently running and instruct it to execute the given expression. This means you need to guarantee the system was already started and be careful with the instructions you are executing. You can also use remote to connect a remote IEx session to the system. Helper module As you operate your system, you may find yourself running some piece of code as a one-off command quite often. You may consider creating a module to group these tasks: # lib/my_app/release_tasks.ex defmodule MyApp.ReleaseTasks do def eval_purge_stale_data ( ) do # Eval commands needs to start the app before # Or Application.load(:my_app) if you can&#39;t start it Application . ensure_all_started ( :my_app ) # Code that purges stale data ... end def rpc_print_connected_users ( ) do # Code that print users connected to the current running system ... end end In the example above, we prefixed the function names with the command name used to execute them, but that is entirely optional. And to run them: $ bin/RELEASE_NAME eval &quot;MyApp.ReleaseTasks.eval_purge_stale_data()&quot; $ bin/RELEASE_NAME rpc &quot;MyApp.ReleaseTasks.rpc_print_connected_users()&quot; Daemon mode (Unix-like) You can run the release in daemon mode with the command: $ bin/RELEASE_NAME daemon In daemon mode, the system is started on the background via run_erl . You may also want to enable heart in daemon mode so it automatically restarts the system in case of crashes. See the generated releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh file. The daemon will write all of its standard output to the &quot;tmp/log/&quot; directory in the release root. You can watch the log file by doing tail -f tmp/log/erlang.log.1 or similar. Once files get too large, the index suffix will be incremented. A developer can also attach to the standard input of the daemon by invoking &quot;to_erl tmp/pipe/&quot; from the release root. However, note that attaching to the system should be done with extreme care, since the usual commands for exiting an Elixir system, such as hitting Ctrl+C twice or Ctrl+\\, will actually shut down the daemon. Therefore, using bin/RELEASE_NAME remote should be preferred, even in daemon mode. You can customize the tmp directory used both for logging and for piping in daemon mode by setting the RELEASE_TMP environment variable. See the &quot;Customization&quot; section. Services mode (Windows) While daemons are not available on Windows, it is possible to install a released system as a service on Windows with the help of erlsrv . This can be done by running: $ bin/RELEASE_NAME install Once installed, the service must be explicitly managed via the erlsrv executable, which is included in the erts-VSN/bin directory. The service is not started automatically after installing. For example, if you have a release named demo , you can install the service and then start it from the release root as follows: $ bin/demo install $ erts-VSN/bin/erlsrv.exe start demo_demo The name of the service is demo_demo because the name is built by concatenating the node name with the release name. Since Elixir automatically uses the same name for both, the service will be referenced as demo_demo . The install command must be executed as an administrator. bin/RELEASE_NAME commands The following commands are supported by bin/RELEASE_NAME : start Starts the system start_iex Starts the system with IEx attached daemon Starts the system as a daemon (Unix-like only) daemon_iex Starts the system as a daemon with IEx attached (Unix-like only) install Installs this system as a Windows service (Windows only) eval &quot;EXPR&quot; Executes the given expression on a new, non-booted system rpc &quot;EXPR&quot; Executes the given expression remotely on the running system remote Connects to the running system via a remote shell restart Restarts the running system via a remote command stop Stops the running system via a remote command pid Prints the operating system PID of the running system via a remote command version Prints the release name and version to be booted Deployments Requirements A release is built on a host , a machine which contains Erlang, Elixir, and any other dependencies needed to compile your application. A release is then deployed to a target , potentially the same machine as the host, but usually separate, and often there are many targets (either multiple instances, or the release is deployed to heterogeneous environments). To deploy straight from a host to a separate target without cross-compilation, the following must be the same between the host and the target: Target architecture (for example, x86_64 or ARM) Target vendor + operating system (for example, Windows, Linux, or Darwin/macOS) Target ABI (for example, musl or gnu) This is often represented in the form of target triples, for example, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu , x86_64-unknown-linux-musl , x86_64-apple-darwin . So to be more precise, to deploy straight from a host to a separate target, the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), and any native dependencies (NIFs), must be compiled for the same target triple. If you are building on a MacBook ( x86_64-apple-darwin ) and trying to deploy to a typical Ubuntu machine ( x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ), the release will not work. Instead you should build the release on a x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu host. As we will see, this can be done in multiple ways, such as releasing on the target itself, or by using virtual machines or containers, usually as part of your release pipeline. In addition to matching the target triple, it is also important that the target has all of the system packages that your application will need at runtime. A common one is the need for OpenSSL when building an application that uses :crypto or :ssl , which is dynamically linked to ERTS. The other common source for native dependencies like this comes from dependencies containing NIFs (natively-implemented functions) which may expect to dynamically link to libraries they use. Of course, some operating systems and package managers can differ between versions, so if your goal is to have full compatibility between host and target, it is best to ensure the operating system and system package manager have the same versions on host and target. This may even be a requirement in some systems, especially so with package managers that try to create fully reproducible environments (Nix, Guix). Similarly, when creating a stand-alone package and release for Windows, note the Erlang Runtime System has a dependency to some Microsoft libraries (Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013). These libraries are installed (if not present before) when Erlang is installed but it is not part of the standard Windows environment. Deploying a stand-alone release on a computer without these libraries will result in a failure when trying to run the release. One way to solve this is to download and install these Microsoft libraries the first time a release is deployed (the Erlang installer version 10.6 ships with “Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable - 12.0.30501”). Alternatively, you can also bundle the compiled object files in the release, as long as they were compiled for the same target. If doing so, you need to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable with the paths containing the bundled objects on Unix-like systems or the $PATH environment variable on Windows systems. Currently, there is no official way to cross-compile a release from one target triple to another, due to the complexities involved in the process. Techniques There are a couple of ways to guarantee that a release is built on a host with the same properties as the target. A simple option is to fetch the source, compile the code and assemble the release on the target itself. It would be something like this: $ git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source $ cd my_app_source $ mix deps.get --only prod $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release $ _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start If you prefer, you can also compile the release to a separate directory, so you can erase all source after the release is assembled: $ git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source $ cd my_app_source $ mix deps.get --only prod $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release --path ../my_app_release $ cd ../my_app_release $ rm -rf ../my_app_source $ bin/my_app start However, this option can be expensive if you have multiple production nodes or if the release assembling process is a long one, as each node needs to individually assemble the release. You can automate this process in a couple different ways. One option is to make it part of your Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline. When you have a CI/CD pipeline, it is common that the machines in your CI/CD pipeline run on the exact same target triple as your production servers (if they don't, they should). In this case, you can assemble the release at the end of your CI/CD pipeline by calling MIX_ENV=prod mix release and push the artifact to S3 or any other network storage. To perform the deployment, your production machines can fetch the deployment from the network storage and run bin/my_app start . Another mechanism to automate deployments is to use images, such as Amazon Machine Images, or container platforms, such as Docker. For instance, you can use Docker to run locally a system with the exact same target triple as your production servers. Inside the container, you can invoke MIX_ENV=prod mix release and build a complete image and/or container with the operating system, all dependencies as well as the releases. In other words, there are multiple ways systems can be deployed and releases can be automated and incorporated into all of them as long as you remember to build the system in the same target triple. Once a system is deployed, shutting down the system can be done by sending SIGINT/SIGTERM to the system, which is what most containers, platforms and tools do, or by explicitly invoking bin/RELEASE_NAME stop . Once the system receives the shutdown request, each application and their respective supervision trees will stop, one by one, in the opposite order that they were started. Customization There are a couple ways in which developers can customize the generated artifacts inside a release. Options The following options can be set inside your mix.exs on each release definition: :applications - a keyword list with application names as keys and their mode as value. By default :applications includes the current application and all applications the current application depends on, recursively. You can include new applications or change the mode of existing ones by listing them here. The order of the applications given will be preserved as much as possible, with only :kernel , :stdlib , :sasl , and :elixir listed before the given application list. The supported values are: :permanent (default) - the application is started and the node shuts down if the application terminates, regardless of reason :transient - the application is started and the node shuts down if the application terminates abnormally :temporary - the application is started and the node does not shut down if the application terminates :load - the application is only loaded :none - the application is part of the release but it is neither loaded nor started If you change the mode of an application, the mode will apply to all its child applications. However, if an application has two parents, the mode of the parent with highest priority wins (where :permanent has the highest priority, according to the list above). :strip_beams - controls if BEAM files should have their debug information, documentation chunks, and other non-essential metadata removed. Defaults to true . May be set to false to disable stripping. Also accepts [keep: [&quot;Docs&quot;, &quot;Dbgi&quot;]] to keep certain chunks that are usually stripped. You can also set the :compress option to true to enable individual compression of BEAM files, although it is typically preferred to compress the whole release instead. :cookie - a string representing the Erlang Distribution cookie. If this option is not set, a random cookie is written to the releases/COOKIE file when the first release is assembled. At runtime, we will first attempt to fetch the cookie from the RELEASE_COOKIE environment variable and then we'll read the releases/COOKIE file. If you are setting this option manually, we recommend the cookie option to be a long and randomly generated string, such as: Base.url_encode64(:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(40)) . We also recommend to restrict the characters in the cookie to the subset returned by Base.url_encode64/1 . :validate_compile_env - by default a release will match all runtime configuration against any configuration that was marked at compile time in your application of its dependencies via the Application.compile_env/3 function. If there is a mismatch between those, it means your system is misconfigured and unable to boot. You can disable this check by setting this option to false. :path - the path the release should be installed to. Defaults to &quot;_build/MIX_ENV/rel/RELEASE_NAME&quot; . :version - the release version as a string or {:from_app, app_name} . Defaults to the current application version. The {:from_app, app_name} format can be used to easily reference the application version from another application. This is particularly useful in umbrella applications. :quiet - a boolean that controls if releases should write steps to the standard output. Defaults to false . :include_erts - a boolean, string, or anonymous function of arity zero. If a boolean, it indicates whether the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), which includes the Erlang VM, should be included in the release. The default is true , which is also the recommended value. If a string, it represents the path to an existing ERTS installation. If an anonymous function of arity zero, it's a function that returns any of the above (boolean or string). You may also set this option to false if you desire to use the ERTS version installed on the target. Note, however, that the ERTS version on the target must have the exact version as the ERTS version used when the release is assembled. Setting it to false also disables hot code upgrades. Therefore, :include_erts should be set to false with caution and only if you are assembling the release on the same server that runs it. :include_executables_for - a list of atoms detailing for which Operating Systems executable files should be generated for. By default, it is set to [:unix, :windows] . You can customize those as follows: releases : [ demo : [ include_executables_for : [ :unix ] # Or [:windows] or [] ] ] :rel_templates_path - the path to find template files that are copied to the release, such as &quot;vm.args.eex&quot;, &quot;remote.vm.args.eex&quot;, &quot;env.sh.eex&quot; (or &quot;env.bat.eex&quot;), and &quot;overlays&quot;. Defaults to &quot;rel&quot; in the project root. :overlays - a list of directories with extra files to be copied as is to the release. The &quot;overlays&quot; directory at :rel_templates_path is always included in this list by default (typically at &quot;rel/overlays&quot;). See the &quot;Overlays&quot; section for more information. :steps - a list of steps to execute when assembling the release. See the &quot;Steps&quot; section for more information. :skip_mode_validation_for - a list of application names (atoms) specifying applications to skip strict validation of &quot;unsafe&quot; modes. An &quot;unsafe&quot; case is when a parent application mode is :permanent but one of the applications it depends on is set to :load . Use this with care, as a release with invalid modes may no longer boot without additional tweaks. Defaults to [] . Note each release definition can be given as an anonymous function. This is useful if some release attributes are expensive to compute: releases : [ demo : fn -&gt; [ version : @version &lt;&gt; &quot;+&quot; &lt;&gt; git_ref ( ) ] end ] Besides the options above, it is possible to customize the generated release with custom files, by tweaking the release steps or by running custom options and commands on boot. We will detail both approaches next. Overlays Often it is necessary to copy extra files to the release root after the release is assembled. This can be easily done by placing such files in the rel/overlays directory. Any file in there is copied as is to the release root. For example, if you have placed a &quot;rel/overlays/Dockerfile&quot; file, the &quot;Dockerfile&quot; will be copied as is to the release root. If you want to specify extra overlay directories, you can do so with the :overlays option. If you need to copy files dynamically, see the &quot;Steps&quot; section. Steps It is possible to add one or more steps before and after the release is assembled. This can be done with the :steps option: releases : [ demo : [ steps : [ &amp; set_configs / 1 , :assemble , &amp; copy_extra_files / 1 ] ] ] The :steps option must be a list and it must always include the atom :assemble , which does most of the release assembling. You can pass anonymous functions before and after the :assemble to customize your release assembling pipeline. Those anonymous functions will receive a Mix.Release struct and must return the same or an updated Mix.Release struct. It is also possible to build a tarball of the release by passing the :tar step anywhere after :assemble . If the release :path is not configured, the tarball is created in _build/MIX_ENV/RELEASE_NAME-RELEASE_VSN.tar.gz Otherwise it is created inside the configured :path . See Mix.Release for more documentation on the struct and which fields can be modified. Note that the :steps field itself can be modified and it is updated every time a step is called. Therefore, if you need to execute a command before and after assembling the release, you only need to declare the first steps in your pipeline and then inject the last step into the release struct. The steps field can also be used to verify if the step was set before or after assembling the release. vm.args and env.sh (env.bat) Developers may want to customize the VM flags and environment variables given when the release starts. The simplest way to customize those files is by running mix release.init . The Mix task will copy custom rel/vm.args.eex , rel/remote.vm.args.eex , rel/env.sh.eex , and rel/env.bat.eex files to your project root. You can modify those files and they will be evaluated every time you perform a new release. Those files are regular EEx templates and they have a single assign, called @release , with the Mix.Release struct. The vm.args and remote.vm.args files may contain any of the VM flags accepted by the erl command . The env.sh and env.bat is used to set environment variables. In there, you can set vars such as RELEASE_NODE , RELEASE_COOKIE , and RELEASE_TMP to customize your node name, cookie and tmp directory respectively. Whenever env.sh or env.bat is invoked, the variables RELEASE_ROOT , RELEASE_NAME , RELEASE_VSN , and RELEASE_COMMAND have already been set, so you can rely on them. See the section on environment variables for more information. Furthermore, while the vm.args files are static, you can use env.sh and env.bat to dynamically set VM options. For example, if you want to make sure the Erlang Distribution listens only on a given port known at runtime, you can set the following: case $RELEASE_COMMAND in start*|daemon*) ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS=&quot;-kernel inet_dist_listen_min $BEAM_PORT inet_dist_listen_max $BEAM_PORT&quot; export ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS ;; *) ;; esac Note we only set the port on start/daemon commands. If you also limit the port on other commands, such as rpc , then you will be unable to establish a remote connection as the port will already be in use by the node. On Windows, your env.bat would look like this: IF NOT %RELEASE_COMMAND:start=%==%RELEASE_COMMAND% ( set ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS=&quot;-kernel inet_dist_listen_min %BEAM_PORT% inet_dist_listen_max %BEAM_PORT%&quot; ) Application configuration Mix provides two mechanisms for configuring the application environment of your application and your dependencies: build-time and runtime. On this section, we will learn how those mechanisms apply to releases. An introduction to this topic can be found in the &quot;Configuration&quot; section of the Mix module. Build-time configuration Whenever you invoke a mix command, Mix loads the configuration in config/config.exs , if said file exists. We say that this configuration is a build-time configuration as it is evaluated whenever you compile your code or whenever you assemble the release. In other words, if your configuration does something like: import Config config :my_app , :secret_key , System . fetch_env! ( &quot;MY_APP_SECRET_KEY&quot; ) The :secret_key key under :my_app will be computed on the host machine, whenever the release is built. Therefore if the machine assembling the release not have access to all environment variables used to run your code, loading the configuration will fail as the environment variable is missing. Luckily, Mix also provides runtime configuration, which should be preferred and we will see next. Runtime configuration To enable runtime configuration in your release, all you need to do is to create a file named config/runtime.exs : import Config config :my_app , :secret_key , System . fetch_env! ( &quot;MY_APP_SECRET_KEY&quot; ) This file will be executed whenever your Mix project or your release starts. Your config/runtime.exs file needs to follow three important rules: It MUST import Config at the top instead of the deprecated use Mix.Config It MUST NOT import any other configuration file via import_config It MUST NOT access Mix in any way, as Mix is a build tool and it is not available inside releases If a config/runtime.exs exists, it will be copied to your release and executed early in the boot process, when only Elixir and Erlang's main applications have been started. You can change the path to the runtime configuration file by setting :runtime_config_path inside each release configuration. This path is resolved at build time as the given configuration file is always copied to inside the release: releases : [ demo : [ runtime_config_path : ... ] ] By setting :runtime_config_path to false it can be used to prevent a runtime configuration file to be included in the release. Config providers Releases also supports custom mechanisms, called config providers, to load any sort of runtime configuration to the system while it boots. For instance, if you need to access a vault or load configuration from a JSON file, it can be achieved with config providers. The runtime configuration outlined in the previous section is handled by the Config.Reader provider. See the Config.Provider module for more information and more examples. The following options can be set inside your releases key in your mix.exs to control how config providers work: :reboot_system_after_config - reboot the system after configuration so you can configure system applications, such as :kernel and :stdlib , in your config/runtime.exs . Generally speaking, it is best to configure :kernel and :stdlib using the vm.args file but this option is available for those who need more complex configuration. When set to true , the release will first boot in interactive mode to compute a config file and write it to the &quot;tmp&quot; directory. Then it reboots in the configured RELEASE_MODE . You can configure the &quot;tmp&quot; directory by setting the RELEASE_TMP environment variable, either explicitly or inside your releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh (or env.bat on Windows). Defaults to true if using the deprecated config/releases.exs , false otherwise. :prune_runtime_sys_config_after_boot - if :reboot_system_after_config is set, every time your system boots, the release will write a config file to your tmp directory. These configuration files are generally small. But if you are concerned with disk space or if you have other restrictions, you can ask the system to remove said config files after boot. The downside is that you will no longer be able to restart the system internally (neither via System.restart/0 nor bin/RELEASE_NAME restart ). If you need a restart, you will have to terminate the Operating System process and start a new one. Defaults to false . :start_distribution_during_config - if :reboot_system_after_config is set, releases only start the Erlang VM distribution features after the config files are evaluated. You can set it to true if you need distribution during configuration. Defaults to false . :config_providers - a list of tuples with custom config providers. See Config.Provider for more information. Defaults to [] . Customization and configuration summary Generally speaking, the following files are available for customizing and configuring the running system: config/config.exs (and config/prod.exs ) - provides build-time application configuration, which are executed when the release is assembled config/runtime.exs - provides runtime application configuration. It is executed every time your Mix project or your release boots and is further extensible via config providers. If you want to detect you are inside a release, you can check for release specific environment variables, such as RELEASE_NODE or RELEASE_MODE rel/vm.args.eex and rel/remote.vm.args.eex - template files that are copied into every release and provides static configuration of the Erlang Virtual Machine and other runtime flags. vm.args runs on start , daemon , and eval commands. remote.vm.args configures the VM for remote and rpc commands rel/env.sh.eex and rel/env.bat.eex - template files that are copied into every release and are executed on every command to set up environment variables, including specific ones to the VM, and the general environment Directory structure A release is organized as follows: bin/ RELEASE_NAME erts-ERTS_VSN/ lib/ APP_NAME-APP_VSN/ ebin/ include/ priv/ releases/ RELEASE_VSN/ consolidated/ elixir elixir.bat env.bat env.sh iex iex.bat remote.vm.args runtime.exs start.boot start.script start_clean.boot start_clean.script sys.config vm.args COOKIE start_erl.data tmp/ We document this structure for completeness. In practice, developers should not modify any of those files after the release is assembled. Instead use env scripts, custom config provider, overlays, and all other mechanisms described in this guide to configure how your release works. Environment variables The system sets different environment variables. The following variables are set early on and can only be read by env.sh and env.bat : RELEASE_ROOT - points to the root of the release. If the system includes ERTS, then it is the same as :code.root_dir/0 . This variable is always computed and it cannot be set to a custom value RELEASE_COMMAND - the command given to the release, such as &quot;start&quot; , &quot;remote&quot; , &quot;eval&quot; , and so on. This is typically accessed inside env.sh and env.bat to set different environment variables under different conditions. Note, however, that RELEASE_COMMAND has not been validated by the time env.sh and env.bat are called, so it may be empty or contain invalid values. This variable is always computed and it cannot be set to a custom value RELEASE_NAME - the name of the release. It can be set to a custom value when invoking the release RELEASE_VSN - the version of the release, otherwise the latest version is used. It can be set to a custom value when invoking the release. The custom value must be an existing release version in the releases/ directory RELEASE_PROG - the command line executable used to start the release The following variables can be set before you invoke the release or inside env.sh and env.bat : RELEASE_COOKIE - the release cookie. By default uses the value in releases/COOKIE . It can be set to a custom value RELEASE_NODE - the release node name, in the format name or optionally name@host if running in distributed mode. It can be set to a custom value. The name part must be made only of letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens RELEASE_SYS_CONFIG - the location of the sys.config file. It can be set to a custom path and it must not include the .config extension RELEASE_VM_ARGS - the location of the vm.args file. It can be set to a custom path RELEASE_REMOTE_VM_ARGS - the location of the remote.vm.args file. It can be set to a custom path RELEASE_TMP - the directory in the release to write temporary files to. It can be set to a custom directory. It defaults to $RELEASE_ROOT/tmp RELEASE_MODE - if the release should load code on demand (interactive) or preload it (embedded). Defaults to &quot;embedded&quot;, which increases boot time but it means the runtime will respond faster as it doesn't have to load code. Choose interactive if you need to decrease boot time and reduce memory usage on boot. It applies only to start/daemon/install commands RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION - how do we want to run the distribution. May be name (long names), sname (short names) or none (distribution is not started automatically). Defaults to sname which allows access only within the current system. name allows external connections RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT - the name of the boot script to use when starting the release. This script is used when running commands such as start and daemon . The boot script is expected to be located at the path releases/RELEASE_VSN/RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT.boot . Defaults to start RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT_CLEAN - the name of the boot script used when starting the release clean, without your application or its dependencies. This script is used by commands such as eval , rpc , and remote . The boot script is expected to be located at the path releases/RELEASE_VSN/RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT_CLEAN.boot . Defaults to start_clean Umbrellas Releases are well integrated with umbrella projects, allowing you to release one or more subsets of your umbrella children. The only difference between performing a release in the umbrella project compared to a regular application is that umbrellas require you to explicitly list your release and the starting point for each release. For example, imagine this umbrella applications: my_app_umbrella/ apps/ my_app_core/ my_app_event_processing/ my_app_web/ where both my_app_event_processing and my_app_web depend on my_app_core but they do not depend on each other. Inside your umbrella, you can define multiple releases: releases : [ web_and_event_processing : [ applications : [ my_app_event_processing : :permanent , my_app_web : :permanent ] ] , web_only : [ applications : [ my_app_web : :permanent ] ] , event_processing_only : [ applications : [ my_app_event_processing : :permanent ] ] ] Note you don't need to define all applications in :applications , only the entry points. Also remember that the recommended mode for all applications in the system is :permanent . Finally, keep in mind it is not required for you to assemble the release from the umbrella root. You can also assemble the release from each child application individually. Doing it from the root, however, allows you to include two applications that do not depend on each other as part of the same release. Hot Code Upgrades Erlang and Elixir are sometimes known for the capability of upgrading a node that is running in production without shutting down that node. However, this feature is not supported out of the box by Elixir releases. The reason we don't provide hot code upgrades is because they are very complicated to perform in practice, as they require careful coding of your processes and applications as well as extensive testing. Given most teams can use other techniques that are language agnostic to upgrade their systems, such as Blue/Green deployments, Canary deployments, Rolling deployments, and others, hot upgrades are rarely a viable option. Let's understand why. In a hot code upgrade, you want to update a node from version A to version B. To do so, the first step is to write recipes for every application that changed between those two releases, telling exactly how the application changed between versions, those recipes are called .appup files. While some of the steps in building .appup files can be automated, not all of them can. Furthermore, each process in the application needs to be explicitly coded with hot code upgrades in mind. Let's see an example. Imagine your application has a counter process as a GenServer: defmodule Counter do use GenServer def start_link ( _ ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , :ok , name : __MODULE__ ) end def bump do GenServer . call ( __MODULE__ , :bump ) end ## Callbacks def init ( :ok ) do { :ok , 0 } end def handle_call ( :bump , counter ) do { :reply , :ok , counter + 1 } end end You add this process as part of your supervision tree and ship version 0.1.0 of your system. Now let's imagine that on version 0.2.0 you added two changes: instead of bump/0 , that always increments the counter by one, you introduce bump/1 that passes the exact value to bump the counter. You also change the state, because you want to store the maximum bump value: defmodule Counter do use GenServer def start_link ( _ ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , :ok , name : __MODULE__ ) end def bump ( by ) do GenServer . call ( __MODULE__ , { :bump , by } ) end ## Callbacks def init ( :ok ) do { :ok , { 0 , 0 } } end def handle_call ( { :bump , by } , { counter , max } ) do { :reply , :ok , { counter + by , max ( max , by ) } } end end If you were to perform a hot code upgrade in such an application, it would crash, because in the initial version the state was just a counter but in the new version the state is a tuple. Furthermore, you changed the format of the call message from :bump to {:bump, by} and the process may have both old and new messages temporarily mixed, so we need to handle both. The final version would be: defmodule Counter do use GenServer def start_link ( _ ) do GenServer . start_link ( __MODULE__ , :ok , name : __MODULE__ ) end def bump ( by ) do GenServer . call ( __MODULE__ , { :bump , by } ) end ## Callbacks def init ( :ok ) do { :ok , { 0 , 0 } } end def handle_call ( :bump , { counter , max } ) do { :reply , :ok , { counter + 1 , max ( max , 1 ) } } end def handle_call ( { :bump , by } , { counter , max } ) do { :reply , :ok , { counter + by , max ( max , by ) } } end def code_change ( _ , counter , _ ) do { :ok , { counter , 0 } } end end Now you can proceed to list this process in the .appup file and hot code upgrade it. This is one of the many steps necessary to perform hot code upgrades and it must be taken into account by every process and application being upgraded in the system. The .appup cookbook provides a good reference and more examples. Once .appup s are created, the next step is to create a .relup file with all instructions necessary to update the release itself. Erlang documentation does provide a chapter on Creating and upgrading a target system . Learn You Some Erlang has a chapter on hot code upgrades . Overall, there are many steps, complexities and assumptions made during hot code upgrades, which is ultimately why they are not provided by Elixir out of the box. However, hot code upgrades can still be achieved by teams who desire to implement those steps on top of mix release in their projects or as separate libraries.

The benefits of releases are:\n\n  * Code preloading. The VM has two mechanisms for loading code:\n    interactive and embedded. By default, it runs in the interactive\n    mode which dynamically loads modules when they are used for the\n    first time. The first time your application calls `Enum.map/2`,\n    the VM will find the `Enum` module and load it. There's a downside:\n    when you start a new server in production, it may need to load\n    many other modules, causing the first requests to have an unusual\n    spike in response time. With releases, the system preloads\n    all modules and guarantees your system is ready to handle requests\n    after booting.\n\n  * Configuration and customization. Releases give developers fine\n    grained control over system configuration and the VM flags used\n    to start the system.\n\n  * Self-contained. A release does not require the source code to be\n    included in your production artifacts. All of the code is precompiled\n    and packaged. Releases do not even require Erlang or Elixir in your\n    servers, as it includes the Erlang VM and its runtime by default.\n    Furthermore, both Erlang and Elixir standard libraries are stripped\n    to bring only the parts you are actually using.\n\n  * Multiple releases. You can assemble different releases with\n    different configuration per application or even with different\n    applications altogether.\n\n  * Management scripts. Releases come with scripts to start, restart,\n    connect to the running system remotely, execute RPC calls, run as\n    daemon, run as a Windows service, and more.\n\n## Running the release\n\nOnce a release is assembled, you can start it by calling\n`bin/RELEASE_NAME start` inside the release. In production, you would do:\n\n    $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release\n    $ _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start\n\n`bin/my_app start` will start the system connected to the current standard\ninput/output, where logs are also written to by default. This is the\npreferred way to run the system. Many tools, such as `systemd`, platforms\nas a service, such as Heroku, and many containers platforms, such as Docker,\nare capable of processing the standard input/output and redirecting\nthe log contents elsewhere. Those tools and platforms also take care\nof restarting the system in case it crashes.\n\nYou can also execute one-off commands, run the release as a daemon on\nUnix-like system, or install it as a service on Windows. We will take a\nlook at those next. You can also list all available commands by invoking\n`bin/RELEASE_NAME`.\n\n### One-off commands (eval and rpc)\n\nIf you want to invoke specific modules and functions in your release,\nyou can do so in two ways: using `eval` or `rpc`.\n\n    $ bin/RELEASE_NAME eval \"IO.puts(:hello)\"\n    $ bin/RELEASE_NAME rpc \"IO.puts(:hello)\"\n\nThe `eval` command starts its own instance of the VM but without\nstarting any of the applications in the release and without starting\ndistribution. For example, if you need to do some prep work before\nrunning the actual system, like migrating your database, `eval` can\nbe a good fit. Just keep in mind any application you may use during\neval has to be explicitly loaded and/or started.\n\nYou can start an application by calling `Application.ensure_all_started/1`.\nHowever, if for some reason you cannot start an application, maybe\nbecause it will run other services you do not want, you must at least\nload the application by calling `Application.load/1`. If you don't\nload the application, any attempt at reading its environment or\nconfiguration may fail. Note that if you start an application,\nit is automatically loaded before started.\n\nAnother way to run commands is with `rpc`, which will connect to the\nsystem currently running and instruct it to execute the given\nexpression. This means you need to guarantee the system was already\nstarted and be careful with the instructions you are executing.\nYou can also use `remote` to connect a remote IEx session to the\nsystem.\n\n#### Helper module\n\nAs you operate your system, you may find yourself running some piece of code\nas a one-off command quite often. You may consider creating a module to group\nthese tasks:\n\n    # lib/my_app/release_tasks.ex\n    defmodule MyApp.ReleaseTasks do\n      def eval_purge_stale_data() do\n        # Eval commands needs to start the app before\n        # Or Application.load(:my_app) if you can't start it\n        Application.ensure_all_started(:my_app)\n\n        # Code that purges stale data\n        ...\n      end\n\n      def rpc_print_connected_users() do\n        # Code that print users connected to the current running system\n        ...\n      end\n    end\n\nIn the example above, we prefixed the function names with the command\nname used to execute them, but that is entirely optional.\n\nAnd to run them:\n\n    $ bin/RELEASE_NAME eval \"MyApp.ReleaseTasks.eval_purge_stale_data()\"\n    $ bin/RELEASE_NAME rpc \"MyApp.ReleaseTasks.rpc_print_connected_users()\"\n\n### Daemon mode (Unix-like)\n\nYou can run the release in daemon mode with the command:\n\n    $ bin/RELEASE_NAME daemon\n\nIn daemon mode, the system is started on the background via\n[`run_erl`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/run_erl.html). You may also\nwant to enable [`heart`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/heart.html)\nin daemon mode so it automatically restarts the system in case\nof crashes. See the generated `releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh` file.\n\nThe daemon will write all of its standard output to the \"tmp/log/\"\ndirectory in the release root. You can watch the log file by doing\n`tail -f tmp/log/erlang.log.1` or similar. Once files get too large,\nthe index suffix will be incremented. A developer can also attach\nto the standard input of the daemon by invoking \"to_erl tmp/pipe/\"\nfrom the release root. However, note that attaching to the system\nshould be done with extreme care, since the usual commands for\nexiting an Elixir system, such as hitting Ctrl+C twice or Ctrl+\\,\nwill actually shut down the daemon. Therefore, using\n`bin/RELEASE_NAME remote` should be preferred, even in daemon mode.\n\nYou can customize the tmp directory used both for logging and for\npiping in daemon mode by setting the `RELEASE_TMP` environment\nvariable. See the \"Customization\" section.\n\n### Services mode (Windows)\n\nWhile daemons are not available on Windows, it is possible to install a\nreleased system as a service on Windows with the help of\n[`erlsrv`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlsrv.html). This can be done by\nrunning:\n\n    $ bin/RELEASE_NAME install\n\nOnce installed, the service must be explicitly managed via the `erlsrv`\nexecutable, which is included in the `erts-VSN/bin` directory.\nThe service is not started automatically after installing.\n\nFor example, if you have a release named `demo`, you can install\nthe service and then start it from the release root as follows:\n\n    $ bin/demo install\n    $ erts-VSN/bin/erlsrv.exe start demo_demo\n\nThe name of the service is `demo_demo` because the name is built\nby concatenating the node name with the release name. Since Elixir\nautomatically uses the same name for both, the service will be\nreferenced as `demo_demo`.\n\nThe `install` command must be executed as an administrator.\n\n### `bin/RELEASE_NAME` commands\n\nThe following commands are supported by `bin/RELEASE_NAME`:\n\n```text\nstart        Starts the system\nstart_iex    Starts the system with IEx attached\ndaemon       Starts the system as a daemon (Unix-like only)\ndaemon_iex   Starts the system as a daemon with IEx attached (Unix-like only)\ninstall      Installs this system as a Windows service (Windows only)\neval \"EXPR\"  Executes the given expression on a new, non-booted system\nrpc \"EXPR\"   Executes the given expression remotely on the running system\nremote       Connects to the running system via a remote shell\nrestart      Restarts the running system via a remote command\nstop         Stops the running system via a remote command\npid          Prints the operating system PID of the running system via a remote command\nversion      Prints the release name and version to be booted\n```\n\n## Deployments\n\n### Requirements\n\nA release is built on a **host**, a machine which contains Erlang, Elixir,\nand any other dependencies needed to compile your application. A release is\nthen deployed to a **target**, potentially the same machine as the host,\nbut usually separate, and often there are many targets (either multiple\ninstances, or the release is deployed to heterogeneous environments).\n\nTo deploy straight from a host to a separate target without cross-compilation,\nthe following must be the same between the host and the target:\n\n  * Target architecture (for example, x86_64 or ARM)\n  * Target vendor + operating system (for example, Windows, Linux, or Darwin/macOS)\n  * Target ABI (for example, musl or gnu)\n\nThis is often represented in the form of target triples, for example,\n`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`.\n\nSo to be more precise, to deploy straight from a host to a separate target,\nthe Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), and any native dependencies (NIFs), must\nbe compiled for the same target triple. If you are building on a MacBook\n(`x86_64-apple-darwin`) and trying to deploy to a typical Ubuntu machine\n(`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`), the release will not work. Instead you should\nbuild the release on a `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` host. As we will see, this\ncan be done in multiple ways, such as releasing on the target itself, or by\nusing virtual machines or containers, usually as part of your release pipeline.\n\nIn addition to matching the target triple, it is also important that the\ntarget has all of the system packages that your application will need at\nruntime. A common one is the need for OpenSSL when building an application\nthat uses `:crypto` or `:ssl`, which is dynamically linked to ERTS. The other\ncommon source for native dependencies like this comes from dependencies\ncontaining NIFs (natively-implemented functions) which may expect to\ndynamically link to libraries they use.\n\nOf course, some operating systems and package managers can differ between\nversions, so if your goal is to have full compatibility between host and\ntarget, it is best to ensure the operating system and system package manager\nhave the same versions on host and target. This may even be a requirement in\nsome systems, especially so with package managers that try to create fully\nreproducible environments (Nix, Guix).\n\nSimilarly, when creating a stand-alone package and release for Windows, note\nthe Erlang Runtime System has a dependency to some Microsoft libraries\n(Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013). These libraries\nare installed (if not present before) when Erlang is installed but it is not\npart of the standard Windows environment. Deploying a stand-alone release on\na computer without these libraries will result in a failure when trying to\nrun the release. One way to solve this is to download and install these\nMicrosoft libraries the first time a release is deployed (the Erlang installer\nversion 10.6 ships with “Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable - 12.0.30501”).\n\nAlternatively, you can also bundle the compiled object files in the release,\nas long as they were compiled for the same target. If doing so, you need to\nupdate `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable with the paths containing the\nbundled objects on Unix-like systems or the `$PATH` environment variable on\nWindows systems.\n\nCurrently, there is no official way to cross-compile a release from one\ntarget triple to another, due to the complexities involved in the process.\n\n### Techniques\n\nThere are a couple of ways to guarantee that a release is built on a host with\nthe same properties as the target. A simple option is to fetch the source,\ncompile the code and assemble the release on the target itself. It would\nbe something like this:\n\n    $ git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source\n    $ cd my_app_source\n    $ mix deps.get --only prod\n    $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release\n    $ _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start\n\nIf you prefer, you can also compile the release to a separate directory,\nso you can erase all source after the release is assembled:\n\n    $ git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source\n    $ cd my_app_source\n    $ mix deps.get --only prod\n    $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release --path ../my_app_release\n    $ cd ../my_app_release\n    $ rm -rf ../my_app_source\n    $ bin/my_app start\n\nHowever, this option can be expensive if you have multiple production\nnodes or if the release assembling process is a long one, as each node\nneeds to individually assemble the release.\n\nYou can automate this process in a couple different ways. One option\nis to make it part of your Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous\nDeployment (CD) pipeline. When you have a CI/CD pipeline, it is common\nthat the machines in your CI/CD pipeline run on the exact same target\ntriple as your production servers (if they don't, they should).\nIn this case, you can assemble the release at the end of your CI/CD\npipeline by calling `MIX_ENV=prod mix release` and push the artifact\nto S3 or any other network storage. To perform the deployment, your\nproduction machines can fetch the deployment from the network storage\nand run `bin/my_app start`.\n\nAnother mechanism to automate deployments is to use images, such as\nAmazon Machine Images, or container platforms, such as Docker.\nFor instance, you can use Docker to run locally a system with the\nexact same target triple as your production servers. Inside the\ncontainer, you can invoke `MIX_ENV=prod mix release` and build\na complete image and/or container with the operating system, all\ndependencies as well as the releases.\n\nIn other words, there are multiple ways systems can be deployed and\nreleases can be automated and incorporated into all of them as long\nas you remember to build the system in the same target triple.\n\nOnce a system is deployed, shutting down the system can be done by\nsending SIGINT/SIGTERM to the system, which is what most containers,\nplatforms and tools do, or by explicitly invoking `bin/RELEASE_NAME stop`.\nOnce the system receives the shutdown request, each application and\ntheir respective supervision trees will stop, one by one, in the\nopposite order that they were started.\n\n## Customization\n\nThere are a couple ways in which developers can customize the generated\nartifacts inside a release.\n\n### Options\n\nThe following options can be set inside your `mix.exs` on each release definition:\n\n  * `:applications` - a keyword list with application names as keys and their\n    mode as value. By default `:applications` includes the current application and\n    all applications the current application depends on, recursively. You can include\n    new applications or change the mode of existing ones by listing them here.\n\n    The order of the applications given will be preserved as much as possible, with\n    only `:kernel`, `:stdlib`, `:sasl`, and `:elixir` listed before the given application\n    list. The supported values are:\n\n      * `:permanent` (default) - the application is started and the node shuts down\n        if the application terminates, regardless of reason\n      * `:transient` - the application is started and the node shuts down\n        if the application terminates abnormally\n      * `:temporary` - the application is started and the node does not\n        shut down if the application terminates\n      * `:load` - the application is only loaded\n      * `:none` - the application is part of the release but it is neither\n        loaded nor started\n\n    If you change the mode of an application, the mode will apply to all its child\n    applications. However, if an application has two parents, the mode of the parent\n    with highest priority wins (where `:permanent` has the highest priority, according\n    to the list above).\n\n  * `:strip_beams` - controls if BEAM files should have their debug information,\n    documentation chunks, and other non-essential metadata removed. Defaults to\n    `true`. May be set to `false` to disable stripping. Also accepts\n   `[keep: [\"Docs\", \"Dbgi\"]]` to keep certain chunks that are usually stripped.\n   You can also set the `:compress` option to true to enable individual\n   compression of BEAM files, although it is typically preferred to compress\n   the whole release instead.\n\n  * `:cookie` - a string representing the Erlang Distribution cookie. If this\n    option is not set, a random cookie is written to the `releases/COOKIE` file\n    when the first release is assembled. At runtime, we will first attempt\n    to fetch the cookie from the `RELEASE_COOKIE` environment variable and\n    then we'll read the `releases/COOKIE` file.\n\n    If you are setting this option manually, we recommend the cookie option\n    to be a long and randomly generated string, such as:\n    `Base.url_encode64(:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(40))`. We also recommend to restrict\n    the characters in the cookie to the subset returned by `Base.url_encode64/1`.\n\n  * `:validate_compile_env` - by default a release will match all runtime\n    configuration against any configuration that was marked at compile time\n    in your application of its dependencies via the `Application.compile_env/3`\n    function. If there is a mismatch between those, it means your system is\n    misconfigured and unable to boot. You can disable this check by setting\n    this option to false.\n\n  * `:path` - the path the release should be installed to.\n    Defaults to `\"_build/MIX_ENV/rel/RELEASE_NAME\"`.\n\n  * `:version` - the release version as a string or `{:from_app, app_name}`.\n    Defaults to the current application version. The `{:from_app, app_name}` format\n    can be used to easily reference the application version from another application.\n    This is particularly useful in umbrella applications.\n\n  * `:quiet` - a boolean that controls if releases should write steps to\n    the standard output. Defaults to `false`.\n\n  * `:include_erts` - a boolean, string, or anonymous function of arity zero.\n    If a boolean, it indicates whether the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), which\n    includes the Erlang VM, should be included in the release. The default is\n    `true`, which is also the recommended value. If a string, it represents\n    the path to an existing ERTS installation. If an anonymous function of\n    arity zero, it's a function that returns any of the above (boolean or string).\n\n    You may also set this option to `false` if you desire to use the ERTS version installed\n    on the target. Note, however, that the ERTS version on the target must have **the\n    exact version** as the ERTS version used when the release is assembled. Setting it to\n    `false` also disables hot code upgrades. Therefore, `:include_erts` should be\n    set to `false` with caution and only if you are assembling the release on the\n    same server that runs it.\n\n  * `:include_executables_for` - a list of atoms detailing for which Operating\n    Systems executable files should be generated for. By default, it is set to\n    `[:unix, :windows]`. You can customize those as follows:\n\n        releases: [\n          demo: [\n            include_executables_for: [:unix] # Or [:windows] or []\n          ]\n        ]\n\n  * `:rel_templates_path` - the path to find template files that are copied to\n    the release, such as \"vm.args.eex\", \"remote.vm.args.eex\", \"env.sh.eex\"\n    (or \"env.bat.eex\"), and \"overlays\". Defaults to \"rel\" in the project root.\n\n  * `:overlays` - a list of directories with extra files to be copied\n    as is to the release. The \"overlays\" directory at `:rel_templates_path`\n    is always included in this list by default (typically at \"rel/overlays\").\n    See the \"Overlays\" section for more information.\n\n  * `:steps` - a list of steps to execute when assembling the release. See\n    the \"Steps\" section for more information.\n\n  * `:skip_mode_validation_for` - a list of application names\n    (atoms) specifying applications to skip strict validation of\n    \"unsafe\" modes. An \"unsafe\" case is when a parent application\n    mode is `:permanent` but one of the applications it depends on\n    is set to `:load`. Use this with care, as a release with\n    invalid modes may no longer boot without additional tweaks.\n    Defaults to `[]`.\n\nNote each release definition can be given as an anonymous function. This\nis useful if some release attributes are expensive to compute:\n\n    releases: [\n      demo: fn ->\n        [version: @version <> \"+\" <> git_ref()]\n      end\n    ]\n\nBesides the options above, it is possible to customize the generated\nrelease with custom files, by tweaking the release steps or by running\ncustom options and commands on boot. We will detail both approaches next.\n\n### Overlays\n\nOften it is necessary to copy extra files to the release root after\nthe release is assembled. This can be easily done by placing such\nfiles in the `rel/overlays` directory. Any file in there is copied\nas is to the release root. For example, if you have placed a\n\"rel/overlays/Dockerfile\" file, the \"Dockerfile\" will be copied as\nis to the release root.\n\nIf you want to specify extra overlay directories, you can do so\nwith the `:overlays` option. If you need to copy files dynamically,\nsee the \"Steps\" section.\n\n### Steps\n\nIt is possible to add one or more steps before and after the release is\nassembled. This can be done with the `:steps` option:\n\n    releases: [\n      demo: [\n        steps: [&set_configs/1, :assemble, &copy_extra_files/1]\n      ]\n    ]\n\nThe `:steps` option must be a list and it must always include the\natom `:assemble`, which does most of the release assembling. You\ncan pass anonymous functions before and after the `:assemble` to\ncustomize your release assembling pipeline. Those anonymous functions\nwill receive a `Mix.Release` struct and must return the same or\nan updated `Mix.Release` struct. It is also possible to build a tarball\nof the release by passing the `:tar` step anywhere after `:assemble`.\nIf the release `:path` is not configured, the tarball is created in\n`_build/MIX_ENV/RELEASE_NAME-RELEASE_VSN.tar.gz` Otherwise it is\ncreated inside the configured `:path`.\n\nSee `Mix.Release` for more documentation on the struct and which\nfields can be modified. Note that the `:steps` field itself can be\nmodified and it is updated every time a step is called. Therefore,\nif you need to execute a command before and after assembling the\nrelease, you only need to declare the first steps in your pipeline\nand then inject the last step into the release struct. The steps\nfield can also be used to verify if the step was set before or\nafter assembling the release.\n\n### vm.args and env.sh (env.bat)\n\nDevelopers may want to customize the VM flags and environment variables\ngiven when the release starts. The simplest way to customize those files\nis by running `mix release.init`. The Mix task will copy custom\n`rel/vm.args.eex`, `rel/remote.vm.args.eex`,  `rel/env.sh.eex`, and\n`rel/env.bat.eex` files to your project root. You can modify those files\nand they will be evaluated every time you perform a new release. Those\nfiles are regular EEx templates and they have a single assign, called\n`@release`, with the `Mix.Release` struct.\n\nThe `vm.args` and `remote.vm.args` files may contain any of the VM flags\naccepted by the [`erl` command](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html).\n\nThe `env.sh` and `env.bat` is used to set environment variables.\nIn there, you can set vars such as `RELEASE_NODE`, `RELEASE_COOKIE`,\nand `RELEASE_TMP` to customize your node name, cookie and tmp\ndirectory respectively. Whenever `env.sh` or `env.bat` is invoked,\nthe variables `RELEASE_ROOT`, `RELEASE_NAME`, `RELEASE_VSN`, and\n`RELEASE_COMMAND` have already been set, so you can rely on them.\nSee the section on environment variables for more information.\n\nFurthermore, while the `vm.args` files are static, you can use\n`env.sh` and `env.bat` to dynamically set VM options. For example,\nif you want to make sure the Erlang Distribution listens only on\na given port known at runtime, you can set the following:\n\n```bash\ncase $RELEASE_COMMAND in\n  start*|daemon*)\n    ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS=\"-kernel inet_dist_listen_min $BEAM_PORT inet_dist_listen_max $BEAM_PORT\"\n    export ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS\n    ;;\n  *)\n    ;;\nesac\n```\n\nNote we only set the port on start/daemon commands. If you also limit\nthe port on other commands, such as `rpc`, then you will be unable\nto establish a remote connection as the port will already be in use\nby the node.\n\nOn Windows, your `env.bat` would look like this:\n\n```bash\nIF NOT %RELEASE_COMMAND:start=%==%RELEASE_COMMAND% (\n  set ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS=\"-kernel inet_dist_listen_min %BEAM_PORT% inet_dist_listen_max %BEAM_PORT%\"\n)\n```\n\n## Application configuration\n\nMix provides two mechanisms for configuring the application environment\nof your application and your dependencies: build-time and runtime. On this\nsection, we will learn how those mechanisms apply to releases. An introduction\nto this topic can be found in the \"Configuration\" section of the `Mix` module.\n\n### Build-time configuration\n\nWhenever you invoke a `mix` command, Mix loads the configuration in\n`config/config.exs`, if said file exists. We say that this configuration\nis a build-time configuration as it is evaluated whenever you compile your\ncode or whenever you assemble the release.\n\nIn other words, if your configuration does something like:\n\n    import Config\n    config :my_app, :secret_key, System.fetch_env!(\"MY_APP_SECRET_KEY\")\n\nThe `:secret_key` key under `:my_app` will be computed on the\nhost machine, whenever the release is built. Therefore if the machine\nassembling the release not have access to all environment variables used\nto run your code, loading the configuration will fail as the environment\nvariable is missing. Luckily, Mix also provides runtime configuration,\nwhich should be preferred and we will see next.\n\n### Runtime configuration\n\nTo enable runtime configuration in your release, all you need to do is\nto create a file named `config/runtime.exs`:\n\n    import Config\n    config :my_app, :secret_key, System.fetch_env!(\"MY_APP_SECRET_KEY\")\n\nThis file will be executed whenever your Mix project or your release\nstarts.\n\nYour `config/runtime.exs` file needs to follow three important rules:\n\n  * It MUST `import Config` at the top instead of the deprecated `use Mix.Config`\n  * It MUST NOT import any other configuration file via `import_config`\n  * It MUST NOT access `Mix` in any way, as `Mix` is a build tool and\n    it is not available inside releases\n\nIf a `config/runtime.exs` exists, it will be copied to your release\nand executed early in the boot process, when only Elixir and Erlang's\nmain applications have been started.\n\nYou can change the path to the runtime configuration file by setting\n`:runtime_config_path` inside each release configuration. This path is\nresolved at build time as the given configuration file is always copied\nto inside the release:\n\n    releases: [\n      demo: [\n        runtime_config_path: ...\n      ]\n    ]\n\nBy setting `:runtime_config_path` to `false` it can be used to prevent\na runtime configuration file to be included in the release.\n\n### Config providers\n\nReleases also supports custom mechanisms, called config providers, to load\nany sort of runtime configuration to the system while it boots. For instance,\nif you need to access a vault or load configuration from a JSON file, it can\nbe achieved with config providers. The runtime configuration outlined in the\nprevious section is handled by the `Config.Reader` provider. See the\n`Config.Provider` module for more information and more examples.\n\nThe following options can be set inside your releases key in your `mix.exs`\nto control how config providers work:\n\n  * `:reboot_system_after_config` - reboot the system after configuration\n    so you can configure system applications, such as `:kernel` and `:stdlib`,\n    in your `config/runtime.exs`. Generally speaking, it is best to configure\n    `:kernel` and `:stdlib` using the `vm.args` file but this option is available\n    for those who need more complex configuration. When set to `true`, the\n    release will first boot in interactive mode to compute a config file and\n    write it to the \"tmp\" directory. Then it reboots in the configured `RELEASE_MODE`.\n    You can configure the \"tmp\" directory by setting the `RELEASE_TMP` environment\n    variable, either explicitly or inside your `releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh`\n    (or `env.bat` on Windows). Defaults to `true` if using the deprecated\n    `config/releases.exs`, `false` otherwise.\n\n  * `:prune_runtime_sys_config_after_boot` - if `:reboot_system_after_config`\n    is set, every time your system boots, the release will write a config file\n    to your tmp directory. These configuration files are generally small.\n    But if you are concerned with disk space or if you have other restrictions,\n    you can ask the system to remove said config files after boot. The downside\n    is that you will no longer be able to restart the system internally (neither\n    via `System.restart/0` nor `bin/RELEASE_NAME restart`). If you need a restart,\n    you will have to terminate the Operating System process and start a new\n    one. Defaults to `false`.\n\n  * `:start_distribution_during_config` - if `:reboot_system_after_config` is\n    set, releases only start the Erlang VM distribution features after the config\n    files are evaluated. You can set it to `true` if you need distribution during\n    configuration. Defaults to `false`.\n\n  * `:config_providers` - a list of tuples with custom config providers.\n    See `Config.Provider` for more information. Defaults to `[]`.\n\n### Customization and configuration summary\n\nGenerally speaking, the following files are available for customizing\nand configuring the running system:\n\n  * `config/config.exs` (and `config/prod.exs`) - provides build-time\n    application configuration, which are executed when the release is\n    assembled\n\n  * `config/runtime.exs` - provides runtime application configuration.\n    It is executed every time your Mix project or your release boots\n    and is further extensible via config providers. If you want to\n    detect you are inside a release, you can check for release specific\n    environment variables, such as `RELEASE_NODE` or `RELEASE_MODE`\n\n  * `rel/vm.args.eex` and `rel/remote.vm.args.eex` - template files that\n    are copied into every release and provides static configuration of the\n    Erlang Virtual Machine and other runtime flags. `vm.args` runs on\n    `start`, `daemon`, and `eval` commands. `remote.vm.args` configures\n    the VM for `remote` and `rpc` commands\n\n  * `rel/env.sh.eex` and `rel/env.bat.eex` - template files that are copied\n    into every release and are executed on every command to set up environment\n    variables, including specific ones to the VM, and the general environment\n\n## Directory structure\n\nA release is organized as follows:\n\n```text\nbin/\n  RELEASE_NAME\nerts-ERTS_VSN/\nlib/\n  APP_NAME-APP_VSN/\n    ebin/\n    include/\n    priv/\nreleases/\n  RELEASE_VSN/\n    consolidated/\n    elixir\n    elixir.bat\n    env.bat\n    env.sh\n    iex\n    iex.bat\n    remote.vm.args\n    runtime.exs\n    start.boot\n    start.script\n    start_clean.boot\n    start_clean.script\n    sys.config\n    vm.args\n  COOKIE\n  start_erl.data\ntmp/\n```\n\nWe document this structure for completeness. In practice, developers\nshould not modify any of those files after the release is assembled.\nInstead use env scripts, custom config provider, overlays, and all\nother mechanisms described in this guide to configure how your release\nworks.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nThe system sets different environment variables. The following variables\nare set early on and can only be read by `env.sh` and `env.bat`:\n\n  * `RELEASE_ROOT` - points to the root of the release. If the system\n    includes ERTS, then it is the same as `:code.root_dir/0`. This\n    variable is always computed and it cannot be set to a custom value\n\n  * `RELEASE_COMMAND` - the command given to the release, such as `\"start\"`,\n    `\"remote\"`, `\"eval\"`, and so on. This is typically accessed inside `env.sh`\n    and `env.bat` to set different environment variables under different\n    conditions. Note, however, that `RELEASE_COMMAND` has not been\n    validated by the time `env.sh` and `env.bat` are called, so it may\n    be empty or contain invalid values. This variable is always computed\n    and it cannot be set to a custom value\n\n  * `RELEASE_NAME` - the name of the release. It can be set to a custom\n    value when invoking the release\n\n  * `RELEASE_VSN` - the version of the release, otherwise the latest\n    version is used. It can be set to a custom value when invoking the\n    release. The custom value must be an existing release version in\n    the `releases/` directory\n\n  * `RELEASE_PROG` - the command line executable used to start the release\n\nThe following variables can be set before you invoke the release or\ninside `env.sh` and `env.bat`:\n\n  * `RELEASE_COOKIE` - the release cookie. By default uses the value\n    in `releases/COOKIE`. It can be set to a custom value\n\n  * `RELEASE_NODE` - the release node name, in the format `name` or\n    optionally `name@host` if running in distributed mode. It can be\n    set to a custom value. The name part must be made only of letters,\n    digits, underscores, and hyphens\n\n  * `RELEASE_SYS_CONFIG` - the location of the sys.config file. It can\n    be set to a custom path and it must not include the `.config` extension\n\n  * `RELEASE_VM_ARGS` - the location of the vm.args file. It can be set\n    to a custom path\n\n  * `RELEASE_REMOTE_VM_ARGS` - the location of the remote.vm.args file.\n    It can be set to a custom path\n\n  * `RELEASE_TMP` - the directory in the release to write temporary\n    files to. It can be set to a custom directory. It defaults to\n    `$RELEASE_ROOT/tmp`\n\n  * `RELEASE_MODE` - if the release should load code on demand (interactive)\n    or preload it (embedded). Defaults to \"embedded\", which increases boot\n    time but it means the runtime will respond faster as it doesn't have to\n    load code. Choose interactive if you need to decrease boot time and reduce\n    memory usage on boot. It applies only to start/daemon/install commands\n\n  * `RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION` - how do we want to run the distribution.\n    May be `name` (long names), `sname` (short names) or `none`\n    (distribution is not started automatically). Defaults to\n    `sname` which allows access only within the current system.\n    `name` allows external connections\n\n  * `RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT` - the name of the boot script to use when starting\n    the release. This script is used when running commands such as `start` and\n    `daemon`. The boot script is expected to be located at the\n    path `releases/RELEASE_VSN/RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT.boot`. Defaults to `start`\n\n  * `RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT_CLEAN` - the name of the boot script used when\n    starting the release clean, without your application or its dependencies.\n    This script is used by commands such as `eval`, `rpc`, and `remote`.\n    The boot script is expected to be located at the path\n    `releases/RELEASE_VSN/RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT_CLEAN.boot`. Defaults\n    to `start_clean`\n\n## Umbrellas\n\nReleases are well integrated with umbrella projects, allowing you to\nrelease one or more subsets of your umbrella children. The only difference\nbetween performing a release in the umbrella project compared to a\nregular application is that umbrellas require you to explicitly list\nyour release and the starting point for each release. For example,\nimagine this umbrella applications:\n\n```text\nmy_app_umbrella/\n  apps/\n    my_app_core/\n    my_app_event_processing/\n    my_app_web/\n```\n\nwhere both `my_app_event_processing` and `my_app_web` depend on\n`my_app_core` but they do not depend on each other.\n\nInside your umbrella, you can define multiple releases:\n\n    releases: [\n      web_and_event_processing: [\n        applications: [\n          my_app_event_processing: :permanent,\n          my_app_web: :permanent\n        ]\n      ],\n\n      web_only: [\n        applications: [my_app_web: :permanent]\n      ],\n\n      event_processing_only: [\n        applications: [my_app_event_processing: :permanent]\n      ]\n    ]\n\nNote you don't need to define all applications in `:applications`,\nonly the entry points. Also remember that the recommended mode\nfor all applications in the system is `:permanent`.\n\nFinally, keep in mind it is not required for you to assemble the\nrelease from the umbrella root. You can also assemble the release\nfrom each child application individually. Doing it from the root,\nhowever, allows you to include two applications that do not depend\non each other as part of the same release.\n\n## Hot Code Upgrades\n\nErlang and Elixir are sometimes known for the capability of upgrading\na node that is running in production without shutting down that node.\nHowever, this feature is not supported out of the box by Elixir releases.\n\nThe reason we don't provide hot code upgrades is because they are very\ncomplicated to perform in practice, as they require careful coding of\nyour processes and applications as well as extensive testing. Given most\nteams can use other techniques that are language agnostic to upgrade\ntheir systems, such as Blue/Green deployments, Canary deployments,\nRolling deployments, and others, hot upgrades are rarely a viable\noption. Let's understand why.\n\nIn a hot code upgrade, you want to update a node from version A to\nversion B. To do so, the first step is to write recipes for every application\nthat changed between those two releases, telling exactly how the application\nchanged between versions, those recipes are called `.appup` files.\nWhile some of the steps in building `.appup` files can be automated,\nnot all of them can. Furthermore, each process in the application needs\nto be explicitly coded with hot code upgrades in mind. Let's see an example.\nImagine your application has a counter process as a GenServer:\n\n    defmodule Counter do\n      use GenServer\n\n      def start_link(_) do\n        GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      def bump do\n        GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :bump)\n      end\n\n      ## Callbacks\n\n      def init(:ok) do\n        {:ok, 0}\n      end\n\n      def handle_call(:bump, counter) do\n        {:reply, :ok, counter + 1}\n      end\n    end\n\nYou add this process as part of your supervision tree and ship version\n0.1.0 of your system. Now let's imagine that on version 0.2.0 you added\ntwo changes: instead of `bump/0`, that always increments the counter by\none, you introduce `bump/1` that passes the exact value to bump the\ncounter. You also change the state, because you want to store the maximum\nbump value:\n\n    defmodule Counter do\n      use GenServer\n\n      def start_link(_) do\n        GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      def bump(by) do\n        GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:bump, by})\n      end\n\n      ## Callbacks\n\n      def init(:ok) do\n        {:ok, {0, 0}}\n      end\n\n      def handle_call({:bump, by}, {counter, max}) do\n        {:reply, :ok, {counter + by, max(max, by)}}\n      end\n    end\n\nIf you were to perform a hot code upgrade in such an application, it would\ncrash, because in the initial version the state was just a counter\nbut in the new version the state is a tuple. Furthermore, you changed\nthe format of the `call` message from `:bump` to `{:bump, by}` and\nthe process may have both old and new messages temporarily mixed, so\nwe need to handle both. The final version would be:\n\n    defmodule Counter do\n      use GenServer\n\n      def start_link(_) do\n        GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)\n      end\n\n      def bump(by) do\n        GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:bump, by})\n      end\n\n      ## Callbacks\n\n      def init(:ok) do\n        {:ok, {0, 0}}\n      end\n\n      def handle_call(:bump, {counter, max}) do\n        {:reply, :ok, {counter + 1, max(max, 1)}}\n      end\n\n      def handle_call({:bump, by}, {counter, max}) do\n        {:reply, :ok, {counter + by, max(max, by)}}\n      end\n\n      def code_change(_, counter, _) do\n        {:ok, {counter, 0}}\n      end\n    end\n\nNow you can proceed to list this process in the `.appup` file and\nhot code upgrade it. This is one of the many steps necessary\nto perform hot code upgrades and it must be taken into account by\nevery process and application being upgraded in the system.\nThe [`.appup` cookbook](https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/appup_cookbook.html)\nprovides a good reference and more examples.\n\nOnce `.appup`s are created, the next step is to create a `.relup`\nfile with all instructions necessary to update the release itself.\nErlang documentation does provide a chapter on\n[Creating and upgrading a target system](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system_principles/create_target.html).\n[Learn You Some Erlang has a chapter on hot code upgrades](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/relups).\n\nOverall, there are many steps, complexities and assumptions made\nduring hot code upgrades, which is ultimately why they are not\nprovided by Elixir out of the box. However, hot code upgrades can\nstill be achieved by teams who desire to implement those steps\non top of `mix release` in their projects or as separate libraries.\n\n## Command line options\n\n  * `--force` - forces recompilation\n  * `--no-archives-check` - does not check archive\n  * `--no-deps-check` - does not check dependencies\n  * `--no-elixir-version-check` - does not check Elixir version\n  * `--no-compile` - does not compile before assembling the release\n  * `--overwrite` - if there is an existing release version, overwrite it\n  * `--path` - the path of the release\n  * `--quiet` - does not write progress to the standard output\n  * `--version` - the version of the release\n\n","title":"Mix.Tasks.Release","type":"task"},{"doc":"Generates sample files for releases. $ mix release.init * creating rel/vm.args.eex * creating rel/remote.vm.args.eex * creating rel/env.sh.eex * creating rel/env.bat.eex","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Release.Init.html","source_doc":"Generates sample files for releases.\n\n    $ mix release.init\n    * creating rel/vm.args.eex\n    * creating rel/remote.vm.args.eex\n    * creating rel/env.sh.eex\n    * creating rel/env.bat.eex\n","title":"Mix.Tasks.Release.Init","type":"task"},{"doc":"Runs the current application. mix run starts the current application dependencies and the application itself.

See the &quot;Operating system process partitioning&quot; section for more information --preload-modules - preloads all modules defined in applications --profile-require time - profiles the time spent to require test files. Used only for debugging. The test suite does not run. --raise - raises if the test suite failed --seed - seeds the random number generator used to randomize the order of tests; --seed 0 disables randomization so the tests in a single file will always be ran in the same order they were defined in --slowest - prints timing information for the N slowest tests. Automatically sets --trace and --preload-modules --stale - runs only tests which reference modules that changed since the last time tests were ran with --stale . You can read more about this option in the &quot;The --stale option&quot; section below --timeout - sets the timeout for the tests --trace - runs tests with detailed reporting. Automatically sets --max-cases to 1 . Note that in trace mode test timeouts will be ignored as timeout is set to :infinity --warnings-as-errors - (since v1.12.0) treats warnings as errors and returns a non-zero exit status. This option only applies to test files. To treat warnings as errors during compilation and during tests, run: MIX_ENV = test mix do compile -- warnings - as - errors + test -- warnings - as - errors Configuration These configurations can be set in the def project section of your mix.exs : :test_coverage - a set of options to be passed down to the coverage mechanism. See the &quot;Coverage&quot; section for more information :test_elixirc_options - the compiler options to used when loading/compiling test files. By default it disables the debug chunk and docs chunk :test_paths - list of paths containing test files. Defaults to [&quot;test&quot;] if the test directory exists; otherwise, it defaults to [] . It is expected that all test paths contain a test_helper.exs file :test_pattern - a pattern to load test files. Defaults to *_test.exs :warn_test_pattern - a pattern to match potentially misnamed test files and display a warning. Defaults to *_test.ex Coloring Coloring is enabled by default on most Unix terminals. They are also available on Windows consoles from Windows 10, although it must be explicitly enabled for the current user in the registry by running the following command: $ reg add HKCU\\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 After running the command above, you must restart your current console. Filters ExUnit provides tags and filtering functionality that allow developers to select which tests to run. The most common functionality is to exclude some particular tests from running by default in your test helper file: # Exclude all external tests from running ExUnit . configure ( exclude : [ external : true ] ) Then, whenever desired, those tests could be included in the run via the --include option: $ mix test --include external:true The example above will run all tests that have the external option set to true . It is also possible to include all examples that have a given tag, regardless of its value: $ mix test --include external Note that all tests are included by default, so unless they are excluded first (either in the test helper or via the --exclude option) the --include option has no effect. For this reason, Mix also provides an --only option that excludes all tests and includes only the given ones: $ mix test --only external Which is similar to: $ mix test --include external --exclude test It differs in that the test suite will fail if no tests are executed when the --only option is used. In case a single file is being tested, it is possible to pass one or more specific line numbers to run only those given tests: $ mix test test/some/particular/file_test.exs:12 Which is equivalent to: $ mix test --exclude test --include line:12 test/some/particular/file_test.exs Or: $ mix test test/some/particular/file_test.exs:12:24 Which is equivalent to: $ mix test --exclude test --include line:12 --include line:24 test/some/particular/file_test.exs If a given line starts a describe block, that line filter runs all tests in it. Otherwise, it runs the closest test on or before the given line number. Coverage Elixir provides built-in line-based test coverage via the --cover flag. The test coverages shows which lines of code and in which files were executed during the test run. Limitations Coverage in Elixir has the following limitations: Literals, such as atoms, strings, and numbers, are not traced by coverage. For example, if a function simply returns :ok , the atom :ok itself is never taken into account by coverage; Macros, such as the ones defined by defmacro/2 and defguard/2 , and code invoked only by macros are never considered as covered, unless they are also invoked during the tests themselves. That's because macros are invoked at compilation time, before the test coverage instrumentation begins; Configuratiuon The :test_coverage configures the coverage tool and accepts the following options: :output - the output directory for cover results. Defaults to &quot;cover&quot; . :tool - a module specifying the coverage tool to use. :summary - at the end of each coverage run, a summary of each module is printed, with results in red or green depending on whether the percentage is below or above a given threshold. The task will exit with status of 1 if the total coverage is below the threshold. The :summary option allows you to customize the summary generation and defaults to [threshold: 90] , but it may be set to false to disable such reports. :export - a filename to export results to instead of generating the coverage result on the fly. The .coverdata extension is automatically added to the given file. This option is automatically set via the --export-coverage option or when using process partitioning. See mix test.coverage to compile a report from multiple exports. :ignore_modules - modules to ignore from generating reports and in summaries. It is a list of module names as atoms and regular expressions that are matched against the module names. :local_only - by default coverage only tracks local calls, set this option to false if you plan to run coverage across nodes. By default, a wrapper around OTP's cover is used as the default coverage tool. You can learn more about how it works in the docs for mix test.coverage . Your tool of choice can be given as follows: def project ( ) do [ ... test_coverage : [ tool : CoverModule ] ... ] end CoverModule can be any module that exports start/2 , receiving the compilation path and the test_coverage options as arguments. It must return either nil or an anonymous function of zero arity that will run after the test suite is done. Operating system process partitioning While ExUnit supports the ability to run tests concurrently within the same Elixir instance, it is not always possible to run all tests concurrently. For example, some tests may rely on global resources. For this reason, mix test supports partitioning the test files across different Elixir instances. This is done by setting the --partitions option to an integer, with the number of partitions, and setting the MIX_TEST_PARTITION environment variable to control which test partition that particular instance is running. This can also be useful if you want to distribute testing across multiple machines. For example, to split a test suite into 4 partitions and run them, you would use the following commands: $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=1 mix test --partitions 4 $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=2 mix test --partitions 4 $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=3 mix test --partitions 4 $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=4 mix test --partitions 4 The test files are sorted upfront in a round-robin fashion. Note the partition itself is given as an environment variable so it can be accessed in config files and test scripts. For example, it can be used to setup a different database instance per partition in config/test.exs . If partitioning is enabled and --cover is used, no cover reports are generated, as they only contain a subset of the coverage data. Instead, the coverage data is exported to files such as cover/MIX_TEST_PARTITION.coverdata . Once you have the results of all partitions inside cover/ , you can run mix test.coverage to get the unified report. The --stale option The --stale command line option attempts to run only the test files which reference modules that have changed since the last time you ran this task with --stale . The first time this task is run with --stale , all tests are run and a manifest is generated. On subsequent runs, a test file is marked &quot;stale&quot; if any modules it references (and any modules those modules reference, recursively) were modified since the last run with --stale . A test file is also marked &quot;stale&quot; if it has been changed since the last run with --stale . The --stale option is extremely useful for software iteration, allowing you to run only the relevant tests as you perform changes to the codebase. File-system watchers You can integrate mix test with filesystem watchers through the command line via the --listen-on-stdin option. For example, you can use fswatch or similar to emit newlines whenever there is a change, which will cause your test suite to re-run: $ fswatch lib test | mix test --listen-on-stdin This can be combined with the --stale option to re-run only the test files that have changed as well as the tests that have gone stale due to changes in lib . Aborting the suite It is possible to abort the test suite with Ctrl+\\ , which sends a SIGQUIT signal to the Erlang VM. ExUnit will intercept this signal to show all tests that have been aborted and print the results collected so far. This can be useful in case the suite gets stuck and you don't want to wait until the timeout times passes (which defaults to 30 seconds).","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Test.html","source_doc":"Runs the tests for a project.\n\nThis task starts the current application, loads up\n`test/test_helper.exs` and then, requires all files matching the\n`test/**/*_test.exs` pattern in parallel.\n\nA list of files and/or directories can be given after the task\nname in order to select the files to run:\n\n    $ mix test test/some/particular/file_test.exs\n    $ mix test test/some/particular/dir\n\nTests in umbrella projects can be run from the root by specifying\nthe full suite path, including `apps/my_app/test`, in which case\nrecursive tests for other child apps will be skipped completely:\n\n    # To run all tests for my_app from the umbrella root\n    $ mix test apps/my_app/test\n\n    # To run a given test file on my_app from the umbrella root\n    $ mix test apps/my_app/test/some/particular/file_test.exs\n\n## Understanding test results\n\nWhen you run your test suite, it prints results as they run with\na summary at the end, as seen below:\n\n    $ mix test\n    ...\n\n      1) test greets the world (FooTest)\n         test/foo_test.exs:5\n         Assertion with == failed\n         code:  assert Foo.hello() == :world!\n         left:  :world\n         right: :world!\n         stacktrace:\n           test/foo_test.exs:6: (test)\n\n    ........\n\n    Finished in 0.05 seconds (0.00s async, 0.05s sync)\n    1 doctest, 11 tests, 1 failure\n\n    Randomized with seed 646219\n\nFor each test, the test suite will print a dot.

In this moduledoc, we will describe how the default test coverage works in Elixir and also explore how it is capable of exporting coverage results to group reports from multiple test runs. Line coverage Elixir uses Erlang's :cover for its default test coverage. Erlang coverage is done by tracking executable lines of code . This implies blank lines, code comments, function signatures, and patterns are not necessarily executable and therefore won't be tracked in coverage reports. Code in macros are also often executed at compilation time, and therefore may not be covered. Similarly, Elixir AST literals, such as atoms, are not executable either. Let's see an example: if some_condition? do do_this ( ) else do_that ( ) end In the example above, if your tests exercise both some_condition? == true and some_condition? == false , all branches will be covered, as they all have executable code. However, the following code if some_condition? do do_this ( ) else :default end won't ever mark the :default branch as covered, as there is no executable code in the else branch. Note, however, this issue does not happen on case or cond , as Elixir is able to mark the clause operator -&gt; as executable in such corner cases: case some_condition? do true -&gt; do_this ( ) false -&gt; :default end If the code above is tested with both conditions, you should see entries in both branches marked as covered. Finally, it is worth discussing that line coverage by itself has its own limitations. For example, take the following code: do_this ( ) || do_that ( ) Line coverage is not capable of expressing that both do_this() and do_that() have been executed, since as soon as do_this() is executed, the whole line is covered. Other techniques, such as branch coverage, can help spot those cases, but they are not currently supported by the default coverage tool. Overall, code coverage can be a great tool for finding flaws in our code (such as functions that haven't been covered) but it can also lead teams into a false sense of security since 100% coverage never means all different executions flows have been asserted, even with the most advanced coverage techniques. It is up to you and your team to specify how much emphasis you want to place on it. Exporting coverage This task can be used when you need to group the coverage across multiple test runs. Let's see some examples. Example: aggregating partitioned runs If you partition your tests across multiple runs, you can unify the report as shown below: $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=1 mix test --partitions 2 --cover $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=2 mix test --partitions 2 --cover $ mix test.coverage This works because the --partitions option automatically exports the coverage results. Example: aggregating coverage reports from all umbrella children If you run mix test.coverage inside an umbrella, it will automatically gather exported cover results from all umbrella children - as long as the coverage results have been exported, like this: # from the umbrella root $ mix test -- cover -- export - coverage default $ mix test . coverage Of course, if you want to actually partition the tests, you can also do: # from the umbrella root $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION = 1 mix test -- partitions 2 -- cover $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION = 2 mix test -- partitions 2 -- cover $ mix test . coverage On the other hand, if you want partitioned tests but per-app reports, you can do: # from the umbrella root $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION = 1 mix test -- partitions 2 -- cover $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION = 2 mix test -- partitions 2 -- cover $ mix cmd mix test . coverage When running test.coverage from the umbrella root, it will use the :test_coverage configuration from the umbrella root. Finally, note the coverage itself is not measured across the projects themselves. For example, if project B depends on A, and if there is code in A that is only executed from project B, those lines will not be marked as covered, which is important, as those projects should be developed and tested in isolation. Other scenarios There may be other scenarios where you want to export coverage. For example, you may have broken your test suite into two, one for unit tests and another for integration tests. In such scenarios, you can explicitly use the --export-coverage command line option, or the :export option under :test_coverage in your mix.exs file.","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Test.Coverage.html","source_doc":"Build reports from exported test coverage.\n\nIn this moduledoc, we will describe how the default test\ncoverage works in Elixir and also explore how it is capable\nof exporting coverage results to group reports from multiple\ntest runs.\n\n## Line coverage\n\nElixir uses Erlang's [`:cover`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/cover.html)\nfor its default test coverage.

Code in macros are\nalso often executed at compilation time, and therefore may not be covered.\nSimilarly, Elixir AST literals, such as atoms, are not executable either.\n\nLet's see an example:\n\n    if some_condition? do\n      do_this()\n    else\n      do_that()\n    end\n\nIn the example above, if your tests exercise both `some_condition? == true`\nand `some_condition? == false`, all branches will be covered, as they all\nhave executable code. However, the following code\n\n    if some_condition? do\n      do_this()\n    else\n      :default\n    end\n\nwon't ever mark the `:default` branch as covered, as there is no executable\ncode in the `else` branch. Note, however, this issue does not happen on `case`\nor `cond`, as Elixir is able to mark the clause operator `->` as executable in\nsuch corner cases:\n\n    case some_condition? do\n      true ->\n        do_this()\n\n      false ->\n        :default\n    end\n\nIf the code above is tested with both conditions, you should see entries\nin both branches marked as covered.\n\nFinally, it is worth discussing that line coverage by itself has its own\nlimitations. For example, take the following code:\n\n    do_this() || do_that()\n\nLine coverage is not capable of expressing that both `do_this()` and\n`do_that()` have been executed, since as soon as `do_this()` is executed,\nthe whole line is covered. Other techniques, such as branch coverage,\ncan help spot those cases, but they are not currently supported by the\ndefault coverage tool.\n\nOverall, code coverage can be a great tool for finding flaws in our\ncode (such as functions that haven't been covered) but it can also lead\nteams into a false sense of security since 100% coverage never means all\ndifferent executions flows have been asserted, even with the most advanced\ncoverage techniques. It is up to you and your team to specify how much\nemphasis you want to place on it.\n\n## Exporting coverage\n\nThis task can be used when you need to group the coverage\nacross multiple test runs. Let's see some examples.\n\n### Example: aggregating partitioned runs\n\nIf you partition your tests across multiple runs,\nyou can unify the report as shown below:\n\n    $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=1 mix test --partitions 2 --cover\n    $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=2 mix test --partitions 2 --cover\n    $ mix test.coverage\n\nThis works because the `--partitions` option\nautomatically exports the coverage results.\n\n### Example: aggregating coverage reports from all umbrella children\n\nIf you run `mix test.coverage` inside an umbrella,\nit will automatically gather exported cover results\nfrom all umbrella children - as long as the coverage\nresults have been exported, like this:\n\n    # from the umbrella root\n    $ mix test --cover --export-coverage default\n    $ mix test.coverage\n\nOf course, if you want to actually partition the tests,\nyou can also do:\n\n    # from the umbrella root\n    $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=1 mix test --partitions 2 --cover\n    $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=2 mix test --partitions 2 --cover\n    $ mix test.coverage\n\nOn the other hand, if you want partitioned tests but\nper-app reports, you can do:\n\n    # from the umbrella root\n    $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=1 mix test --partitions 2 --cover\n    $ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=2 mix test --partitions 2 --cover\n    $ mix cmd mix test.coverage\n\nWhen running `test.coverage` from the umbrella root, it\nwill use the `:test_coverage` configuration from the umbrella\nroot.\n\nFinally, note the coverage itself is not measured across\nthe projects themselves. For example, if project B depends\non A, and if there is code in A that is only executed from\nproject B, those lines will not be marked as covered, which\nis important, as those projects should be developed and tested\nin isolation.\n\n### Other scenarios\n\nThere may be other scenarios where you want to export coverage.\nFor example, you may have broken your test suite into two, one\nfor unit tests and another for integration tests. In such scenarios,\nyou can explicitly use the `--export-coverage` command line option,\nor the `:export` option under `:test_coverage` in your `mix.exs` file.\n","title":"Mix.Tasks.Test.Coverage","type":"task"},{"doc":"Prints cross reference information between modules. The xref task expects a mode as first argument: $ mix xref MODE All available modes are discussed below. This task is automatically re-enabled, so you can print information multiple times in the same Mix invocation. mix xref callers MODULE Prints all callers of the given module. Example: $ mix xref callers MyMod mix xref trace FILE Compiles the given file listing all dependencies within the same app. It includes the type and line for each one. Example: $ mix xref trace lib/my_app/router.ex The --label option may be given to keep only certain traces (compile, runtime or export): $ mix xref trace lib/my_app/router.ex --label compile If you have an umbrella application, we also recommend using the --include-siblings flag to see the dependencies on other umbrella applications.

Can be repeated to exclude multiple paths. --label - only shows relationships with the given label. The labels are &quot;compile&quot;, &quot;export&quot; and &quot;runtime&quot;. By default, the --label option simply filters the printed graph to show only relationships with the given label. You can pass --only-direct to trim the graph to only the nodes that have the direct relationship given by label. There is also a special label called &quot;compile-connected&quot; that keeps only compile-time files with at least one transitive dependency. See &quot;Dependency types&quot; section below. --group - provide comma-separated paths to consider as a group. Dependencies from and into multiple files of the group are considered a single dependency. Dependencies between the group elements are ignored. This is useful when you are computing compile and compile-connected dependencies and you want a series of files to be treated as one. The group is printed using the first path, with a + suffix. Can be repeated to create multiple groups. --only-direct - keeps only files with the direct relationship given by --label --only-nodes - only shows the node names (no edges). Generally useful with the --sink flag --source - displays all files that the given source file references (directly or indirectly). Can be repeated to display references from multiple sources. --sink - displays all files that reference the given file (directly or indirectly). Can be repeated. --min-cycle-size - controls the minimum cycle size on formats like stats and cycles --format - can be set to one of: pretty - prints the graph to the terminal using Unicode characters. Each prints each file followed by the files it depends on. This is the default except on Windows; plain - the same as pretty except ASCII characters are used instead of Unicode characters. This is the default on Windows; stats - prints general statistics about the graph; cycles - prints all cycles in the graph; dot - produces a DOT graph description in xref_graph.dot in the current directory. Warning: this will override any previously generated file --output (since v1.15.0) - can be set to one of - - prints the output to standard output; a path - writes the output graph to the given path Defaults to xref_graph.dot in the current directory. The --source and --sink options are particularly useful when trying to understand how the modules in a particular file interact with the whole system. You can combine those options with --label and --only-nodes to get all files that exhibit a certain property, for example: # To show all compile-time relationships $ mix xref graph -- label compile # To get the tree that depend on lib/foo.ex at compile time $ mix xref graph -- label compile -- sink lib / foo . ex # To get all files that depend on lib/foo.ex at compile time $ mix xref graph -- label compile -- sink lib / foo . ex -- only - nodes # To get all paths between two files $ mix xref graph -- source lib / foo . ex -- sink lib / bar . ex # To show general statistics about the graph $ mix xref graph -- format stats Understanding the printed graph When mix xref graph runs, it will print a tree of the following format. Imagine the following code: # lib/a.ex defmodule A do IO . puts B . hello ( ) end # lib/b.ex defmodule B do def hello , do : C . world ( ) end # lib/c.ex defmodule C do def world , do : &quot;hello world&quot; end It will print: $ mix xref graph lib/a.ex └── lib/b.ex (compile) lib/b.ex └── lib/c.ex lib/c.ex This tree means that lib/a.ex depends on lib/b.ex at compile time. And lib/b.ex depends on lib/c.ex at runtime. This is often problematic because if lib/c.ex changes, lib/a.ex also has to recompile due to this indirect compile time dependency. When you pass --label compile , the graph shows only the compile-time dependencies: $ mix xref graph --label compile lib/a.ex └── lib/b.ex (compile) The --label compile flag removes all non-compile dependencies. However, this can be misleading because having direct compile time dependencies is not necessarily an issue. The biggest concern, as mentioned above, are the transitive compile time dependencies. You can get all compile time dependencies that cause transitive compile time dependencies by using --label compile-connected : $ mix xref graph --label compile-connected lib/a.ex └── lib/b.ex (compile) The above says lib/a.ex depends on lib/b.ex and that causes transitive compile time dependencies - as we know, lib/a.ex also depends on lib/c.ex . We can retrieve those transitive dependencies by passing lib/b.ex as --source to mix xref graph : $ mix xref graph --source lib/b.ex lib/b.ex └── lib/c.ex Similarly, you can use the --label compile and the --sink flag to find all compile time dependencies that will recompile once the sink changes: $ mix xref graph --label compile --sink lib/c.ex lib/a.ex └── lib/b.ex (compile) Dependency types Elixir tracks three types of dependencies between modules: compile, exports, and runtime. If a module has a compile time dependency on another module, the caller module has to be recompiled whenever the callee changes. Compile-time dependencies are typically added when using macros or when invoking functions in the module body (outside of functions). You can list all dependencies in a file by running mix xref trace path/to/file.ex . Export dependencies are compile time dependencies on the module API, namely structs and its public definitions. For example, if you import a module but only use its functions, it is an export dependency. If you use a struct, it is an export dependency too. Export dependencies are only recompiled if the module API changes. Note, however, that compile time dependencies have higher precedence than exports. Therefore if you import a module and use its macros, it is a compile time dependency. Runtime dependencies are added whenever you invoke another module inside a function. Modules with runtime dependencies do not have to be compiled when the callee changes, unless there is a transitive compile or an outdated export time dependency between them. The option --label compile-connected can be used to find the first case. Shared options Those options are shared across all modes: --fail-above - generates a failure if the relevant metric is above the given threshold. Applies to all modes except mix xref graph --format stats . --include-siblings - includes dependencies that have :in_umbrella set to true in the current project in the reports. This can be used to find callers or to analyze graphs between projects --no-compile - does not compile even if files require compilation --no-deps-check - does not check dependencies --no-archives-check - does not check archives --no-elixir-version-check - does not check the Elixir version from mix.exs","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Xref.html","source_doc":"Prints cross reference information between modules.\n\nThe `xref` task expects a mode as first argument:\n\n    $ mix xref MODE\n\nAll available modes are discussed below.\n\nThis task is automatically re-enabled, so you can print\ninformation multiple times in the same Mix invocation.\n\n## mix xref callers MODULE\n\nPrints all callers of the given module.
